(HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 5)\n*   **Hospice Benefit Election:** Medicaid patients may elect the hospice benefit. By signing the Notice of Election form, the patient/representative acknowledges understanding that certain Medicare/Medicaid services are waived by this election. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 5)\n*   **Levels of Care:** The Medicaid hospice benefit includes four different levels of care: Routine Care, General Inpatient Care, Respite Care, and Continuous Home Care. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 18)\n*   **Curative Treatment Exception:** Pediatric continuous care patients on Medicaid may receive both curative and hospice services at the same time. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 5)\n\nThe provided context also generally states that Federal and State governments have specific standards of care for home health and hospice, which Intermountain Homecare & Hospice, as a Medicare certified and Joint Commission accredited program, must abide by. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 1) Medicaid is listed as one of the funding sources for home health or hospice services. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 1)"

        "answer": "Here are important facts to know about home health services:\n\n**Home Health Aide Services**\nFor home health aide services to be covered, the patient must meet specific qualifying criteria, the services must be part-time or intermittent, they must meet the definition of home health aide services, and they must be reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the patient's illness or injury. A home health aide must also be certified. The purpose of home health aide visits is to provide hands-on personal care or services needed to maintain the patient's health or facilitate treatment. The physician's order should specify the frequency of these services. Personal care can include bathing, dressing, grooming, oral hygiene, changing bed linens for incontinent patients, shaving, deodorant application, skin care, foot care, ear care, feeding, assistance with elimination (including enemas unless licensed nurse skills are needed, routine catheter and colostomy care), assistance with ambulation, changing position in bed, and transfers.\n[Source: CMSHH.pdf, Page: 79]\n\n**Other Home Health Services**\n*   **Therapy services** must be reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the patient\u2019s illness or injury, or for the restoration or maintenance of function affected by the illness or injury.\n*   **Hospice care** must be reasonable and necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related conditions.\n[Source: HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 7]\n\n**Homebound Status**\nA patient is considered homebound if two criteria are met:\n1.  **The patient must either:**\n    *   Need the aid of supportive devices (e.g., crutches, cane, walker, wheelchair) or the assistance of another person to leave their place of residence due to illness or injury.\n    *   Have a condition where leaving the home is medically contraindicated.\n2.  **There must be:**\n    *   A normal inability to leave home.\n    *   Leaving home must require a considerable and taxing effort.\n\n**Acceptable Reasons for Leaving Home While Homebound:**\nIf the patient does leave home, it should be infrequent, for short periods, or to receive health care (e.g., kidney dialysis, chemotherapy, or radiation). A patient may also leave home to attend church or a hairdresser appointment and still be considered homebound.\n\n**Conditions that Indicate a Patient May NOT Be Homebound:**\nA patient would generally not be considered homebound if they:\n*   Leave home frequently for non-medical reasons.\n*   Drive a car.\n*   Leave the home against medical advice.\n*   Leave the home for business purposes or to attend school.\n\n**Documentation of Homebound Status:**\nHomebound status must be documented at every Home Health visit. This documentation should be updated as the patient\u2019s condition changes, supported by diagnosis, symptoms, and/or medical condition, consistent across all discipline notes, and stated in clear, concise, specific, and measurable terms.\n\n**Pediatric Patients:**\nPediatric patients can be considered homebound if leaving home is medically contraindicated.\n[Source: HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 7]"
