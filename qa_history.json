(HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 5)\n*   **Hospice Benefit Election:** Medicaid patients may elect the hospice benefit. By signing the Notice of Election form, the patient/representative acknowledges understanding that certain Medicare/Medicaid services are waived by this election. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 5)\n*   **Levels of Care:** The Medicaid hospice benefit includes four different levels of care: Routine Care, General Inpatient Care, Respite Care, and Continuous Home Care. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 18)\n*   **Curative Treatment Exception:** Pediatric continuous care patients on Medicaid may receive both curative and hospice services at the same time. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 5)\n\nThe provided context also generally states that Federal and State governments have specific standards of care for home health and hospice, which Intermountain Homecare & Hospice, as a Medicare certified and Joint Commission accredited program, must abide by. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 1) Medicaid is listed as one of the funding sources for home health or hospice services. (HomeHealth.pdf, Page: 1)"
