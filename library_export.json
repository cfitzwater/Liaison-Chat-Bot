The beneficiary's location is the \ndetermining factor for the labor adjustment.  The HH PPS rates are adjusted by the pre-\nfloor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index.  The hospital wage index is adjusted to \naccount for the geographic reclassification of hospitals in accordance with \n\u00a7\u00a71886(d)(8)(B) and 1886(d)(10)\n of the Social Security Act (the Act.)  According to the \nlaw, geographic reclassification only applies to hospitals.  Additionally, the hospital wage \nindex has specific floors that are required by law.  Because these reclassifications and \nfloors do not apply to HHAs, the home health rates are adjusted by the pre-floor and pre-\nreclassified hospital wage index. \n \nNOTE: The pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index varies slightly from the \nnumbers published in the Medicare inpatient hospital PPS regulation that reflects the \nfloor and reclassification adjustments.  The wage indices published in the home health \nfinal rule and subsequent annual updates reflect the most recent available pre-floor and \npre-reclassified hospital wage index available at the time of publication. \n \n10.3 - Continuous 60-Day Recertifications \n(Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20) \n \nWhile HH PPS payment is now made for each 30-day period, the home health PPS \npermits continuous 60-day recertifications for patients who continue to be eligible for the \nhome health benefit.  Medicare does not limit the number of continuous 60-day \nrecertifications for beneficiaries who continue to be eligible for the home health benefit.\n \nEach 60-day certification can include two 30-day payment periods. \n \nRecertification is required at least every 60 days when there is a need for continuous \nhome health care after an initial 60-day certification. The recertification visit can be done \nduring the prior certification period.  With some minor exceptions, the Medicare \nConditions of Participation at 42 CFR 484.55(d)(1), require that the recertification \nassessment be done during the last 5 days of the previous certification period (for \nexample, during the initial 60-day certification period, the recertification visit is required \nto be done on days 56-60). \n \n10.4 - Submission of the Notice of Admission (NOA)                               \n(Rev. 11447, Issued: 06-06-22, Effective: 01-01-22, Implementation: 05-26-22) \n \nBeginning January 1, 2022, HHAs will no longer submit Requests for Anticipated \nPayment (RAPs). Instead, for each admission to home health, the HHA notifies Medicare \nsystems via submission of an NOA. The NOA is a one-time submission to establish that \nthe beneficiary is under a home health period of care and trigger home health \nconsolidated billing edits. The NOA covers contiguous 30-day periods of care until the \nindividual is discharged from Medicare home health services. There is no upfront \npayment with the submission of the NOA.  \n "

The partial \npayment adjustment will be calculated by using the span of days (first billable service \ndate through and including the last billable service date) under the original plan of care as \na proportion of the 30-day period. The proportion will then be multiplied by the original \ncase-mix and wage index to produce the 30-day payment. \n \nC.  Common Ownership Exception to Partial Payment Adjustment \n \nThe partial payment adjustment does not apply in situations of transfers among HHAs of \ncommon ownership.  Those situations would be considered services provided under \narrangement on behalf of the originating HHA by the receiving HHA with the ownership \ninterest until the end of the 30-day period.  The common ownership exception to the \ntransfer partial payment adjustment does not apply if the beneficiary moved out of their \nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or non-MSA during the 30-day period before the \ntransfer to the receiving HHA. \n \nD.  Beneficiary Elected Transfer Verification \n \nIn order for a receiving HHA to accept a beneficiary elected transfer, the receiving HHA \nmust document that the beneficiary has been informed that the initial HHA will no longer \nreceive Medicare payment on behalf of the patient and will no longer provide Medicare \ncovered services to the patient after the date of the patient's elected transfer in accordance \nwith current patient rights requirements at 42 CFR 484.50(d)\n.  The receiving HHA must \nalso document in the record that it accessed the Medicare contractor\u2019s inquiry system to \ndetermine whether or not the patient was under an established home health plan of care \nand it must contact the initial HHA on the effective date of transfer.  In the rare \ncircumstance of a dispute between HHAs, the Medicare contractor is responsible for \nworking with both HHAs to resolve the dispute. If the receiving HHA can provide \ndocumentation of its notice of patient rights on Medicare payment liability provided to \nthe patient upon transfer and its contact of the initial HHA of the transfer date, then the \ninitial HHA will be ineligible for payment for the period of overlap in addition to the \nappropriate partial payment adjustment.  If the receiving HHA cannot provide the \nappropriate documentation, the receiving HHA's RAP and/or final claim will be \ncancelled, and full period payment will be provided to the initial HHA.  For the receiving \nHHA to properly document that it contacted the initial HHA on the effective date of \ntransfer it must maintain similar information as the initial HHA, including the same basic \nbeneficiary information, personnel contacted, dates and times.  The initial HHA must also \nproperly document that it was contacted and it accepted the transfer.  Where it disputes a \ntransfer, the initial HHA must call its Medicare contractor to resolve the dispute.  The \nMedicare contractor is responsible for working with both HHAs to resolve the dispute.

Outlier payments can result from medically necessary high \nutilization in any or all-home health service disciplines.  CMS makes outlier payments \nwhen the cost of care exceeds a threshold dollar amount.  The outlier threshold for each \ncase-mix group is the 30-day period payment amount for that group or the partial \npayment adjustment amount for the 30-day period, plus a fixed dollar loss amount, which \nis the same for all case-mix groups.  The outlier payment is a proportion of the amount of \nimputed costs beyond the threshold.  CMS calculates the imputed cost for each 30-day \nperiod by first taking the national per-visit payment amounts for each discipline and \ncalculating per-unit payment amounts (1 unit = 15 minutes).  The per-unit amounts are \nthen multiplied by the number of units in the discipline and computing the total imputed \ncost for all disciplines (summed across the six disciplines of care). \n \nIf the imputed cost for the 30-day period is greater than the sum of the case-mix and \nwage-adjusted 30-day period payment plus the fixed dollar loss amount (the outlier \nthreshold), a set percentage (the loss sharing ratio) of the difference between the imputed \namount and outlier threshold will be paid to the HHA as a wage-adjusted outlier payment \nin addition to the 30-day period payment. \n \nThe amount of the outlier payment is determined as follows: \n \n1. Calculate the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment (including non-\nroutine supplies (NRS)); \n \n2. Add the wage-adjusted fixed dollar loss amount.  The sum of steps 1 and 2 is the \noutlier threshold for the 30-day period; \n \n3. Calculate the wage-adjusted imputed cost of the 30-day period by first \nmultiplying the total number of units for each home health discipline by the \nnational per unit amounts, and wage-adjusting those amounts.  Sum the per \ndiscipline wage-adjusted imputed amounts to yield the total wage-adjusted \nimputed cost for the 30-day period; \n \n4. Subtract the total imputed cost for the 30-day period (total from Step 3) from the \nsum of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment and the wage-\nadjusted fixed dollar loss amount (sum of Steps 1 and 2 - outlier threshold); \n \n5. Multiply the difference by the loss sharing ratio; and \n \n6. That total amount is the outlier payment for the 30-day period. \nEffective January 1, 2010, an outlier cap precludes any HHA from receiving more than 10 \npercent of their total home health payment in outliers.

Hospice Election Mid-Period  \n \nIf a patient elects hospice before the end of the 30-day period and there \nwas no partial payment adjustment or LUPA adjustment, the HHA will \nreceive a full 30-day period payment. The 30-day period with visits less \nthan the LUPA threshold for the payment group would be paid at the low \nutilization payment adjusted amount. \n \nB. Patient's Death \n \nThe documented event of a patient's death would result in a full 30-day \nperiod payment, unless the death occurred in a low utilization payment \nadjusted 30-day period. Consistent with all episodes in which a patient \nreceives four or fewer visits, if the patient's death occurred during a low \nutilization adjusted 30-day payment period, the period would be paid at \nthe low utilization payment adjusted amount. In the event of a patient's \ndeath during an adjusted 30-day period, the total adjusted period would \nconstitute the full 30- day period payment.  \n \nC. Patient is No Longer Eligible for Home Health (e.g., no longer \nhomebound, no skilled need)  \n \nIf the patient is discharged because he or she is no longer eligible for the \nMedicare home health benefit and has received visits meeting the LUPA \nthreshold for the payment group, then the HHA would receive the full 30-\nday period payment. However, if the patient becomes subsequently \neligible for the Medicare home health benefit during the same 30- day \nperiod and transferred to another HHA or returned to the same HHA, then \nthis would result in a partial payment adjustment. \n \nD. Discharge Due to Patient Refusal of Services or is a Documented \nSafety Threat, Abuse Threat or is Noncompliant \n \nIf the patient is discharged because he or she refuses services or becomes \na documented safety, abuse, or noncompliance discharge and has received \nvisits meeting the LUPA threshold for the payment group, then the HHA \nwould receive full period payment unless the patient becomes \nsubsequently eligible for the Medicare home health benefit during the \nsame 30-day period and transferred to another HHA or returned to the \nsame HHA, then this would result in a partial payment adjustment. \n \nE.

Therefore, \na patient is entitled to have the costs of reasonable and necessary services reimbursed by \nMedicare without regard to whether there is someone available to furnish the services.  \nHowever, where a family member or other person is or will be providing services that \nadequately meet the patient's needs, it would not be reasonable and necessary for HHA \npersonnel to furnish such services.  Ordinarily it can be presumed that there is no able \nand willing person in the home to provide the services being rendered by the HHA unless \nthe patient or family indicates otherwise and objects to the provision of the services by \nthe HHA, or unless the HHA has first hand knowledge to the contrary. \n \nSimilarly, a patient is entitled to reasonable and necessary Medicare home health services \neven if the patient would qualify for institutional care (e.g., hospital care or skilled \nnursing facility care) and Medicare payment should be made for reasonable and \nnecessary home health services where the patient is also receiving supplemental services \nthat do not meet Medicare\u2019s definition of skilled nursing care or home health aide \nservices. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nA patient who lives with an adult daughter and otherwise qualifies for Medicare coverage \nof home health services, requires the assistance of a home health aide for bathing and \nassistance with an exercise program to improve endurance.  The daughter is unwilling to \nbathe her elderly father and assist him with the exercise program.  Home health aide \nservices would be reasonable and necessary. \n \nEXAMPLE 2: \n \nA patient who is being discharged from a hospital with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis and \nrequires continuation of the I.V. antibiotic therapy that was begun in the hospital was \nfound to meet the criteria for Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility services.  If \nthe patient also meets the qualifying criteria for coverage of home health services, \npayment may be made for the reasonable and necessary home health services the patient \nneeds, notwithstanding the availability of coverage in a skilled nursing facility. \n \nEXAMPLE 3: \n \nA patient who needs skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis also hires a licensed \npractical (vocational) nurse to provide nighttime assistance while family members sleep.  \nThe care provided by the nurse, as respite to the family members, does not require the "

For purposes of the statute, an individual shall be \nconsidered \u201cconfined to the home\u201d (homebound) if the following two criteria are met: \n \n1. Criterion One: \n \nThe patient must either: \n \n- Because of illness or injury, need the aid of supportive devices such as \ncrutches, canes, wheelchairs, and walkers; the use of special transportation; or \nthe assistance of another person in order to leave their place of residence \n \nOR \n \n- Have a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically \ncontraindicated. \n \nIf the patient meets one of the criterion one conditions, then the patient must ALSO meet \ntwo additional requirements defined in criterion two below. \n \n2. Criterion Two: \n \n- There must exist a normal inability to leave home; \n \nAND \n \n- Leaving home must require a considerable and taxing effort. \n \nTo clarify, in determining whether the patient meets criterion two of the homebound \ndefinition, the clinician needs to take into account the illness or injury for which the \npatient met criterion one and consider the illness or injury in the context of the patient\u2019s \noverall condition.  The clinician is not required to include standardized phrases reflecting \nthe patient\u2019s condition (e.g., repeating the words \u201ctaxing effort to leave the home\u201d) in the \npatient\u2019s chart, nor are such phrases sufficient, by themselves, to demonstrate that \ncriterion two has been met.  For example, longitudinal clinical information about the \npatient\u2019s health status is typically needed to sufficiently demonstrate a normal inability to \nleave the home and that leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort.  Such \nclinical information about the patient\u2019s overall health status may include, but is not \nlimited to, such factors as the patient\u2019s diagnosis, duration of the patient\u2019s condition, \nclinical course (worsening or improvement), prognosis, nature and extent of functional \nlimitations, other therapeutic interventions and results, etc. \n "

A patient, under a Medicare home health \nplan of care, who resides in more than one place of residence during a period of Medicare \ncovered home health services will not disqualify the patient's homebound status for \npurposes of eligibility.  For example, a person may reside in a principal home and also a \nsecond vacation home, mobile home, or the home of a caretaker relative.

Day Care Centers and Patient's Place of Residence \n \nThe current statutory definition of homebound or confined does not imply that Medicare \ncoverage has been expanded to include adult day care services. \n \nThe law does not permit an HHA to furnish a Medicare covered billable visit to a patient \nunder a home health plan of care outside his or her home, except in those limited \ncircumstances where the patient needs to use medical equipment that is too cumbersome \nto bring to the home.  Section 1861(m) of the Act stipulates that home health services \nprovided to a patient be provided to the patient on a visiting basis in a place of residence \nused as the individual's home.  A licensed/certified day care center does not meet the \ndefinition of a place of residence. \n \nC.  State Licensure/Certification of Day Care Facilities \n \nPer Section 1861(m)\n of the Act, an adult day care center must be either licensed or \ncertified by the State or accredited by a private accrediting body.  State licensure or \ncertification as an adult day care facility must be based on State interpretations of its \nprocess.  For example, several States do not license adult day care facilities as a whole, \nbut do certify some entities as Medicaid certified centers for purposes of providing adult \nday care under the Medicaid home and community based waiver program.  It is the \nresponsibility of the State to determine the necessary criteria for \"State certification\" in \nsuch a situation.  A State could determine that Medicaid certification is an acceptable \nstandard and consider its Medicaid certified adult day care facilities to be \"State \ncertified.\"  On the other hand, a State could determine Medicaid certification to be \ninsufficient and require other conditions to be met before the adult day care facility is \nconsidered \"State certified\". \n \nD.  Determination of the Therapeutic, Medical or Psychosocial Treatment of the \nPatient at the Day Care Facility \n \nIt is not the obligation of the HHA to determine whether the adult day care facility is \nproviding psychosocial treatment, but only to assure that the adult day care center is \nlicensed/certified by the State or accrediting body.  The intent of the law, in extending the \nhomebound exception status to attendance at such adult day care facilities, recognizes \nthat they ordinarily furnish psychosocial services. \n \n30.2 - Services Are Provided Under a Plan of Care Established and \nApproved by a Physician or Allowed Practitioner                                  \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) "

When, however, the individualized assessment \ndoes not demonstrate such a necessity for skilled care, including when the services \nneeded do not require skilled nursing care because they could safely and effectively be \nperformed by the patient or unskilled caregivers, such services will not be covered under \nthe home health benefit. \n \nSkilled nursing care is necessary only when (a) the particular patient\u2019s special medical \ncomplications require the skills of a registered nurse or, when provided by regulation, a \nlicensed practical nurse to perform a type of service that would otherwise be considered \nnon-skilled; or (b) the needed services are of such complexity that the skills of a \nregistered nurse or, when provided by regulation, a licensed practical nurse are required \nto furnish the services.

To be considered reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or \ntreatment of the patient's illness or injury, the services must be consistent with the nature \nand severity of the illness or injury, the patient's particular medical needs, and accepted \nstandards of medical and nursing practice.  The determination of whether the services are \nreasonable and necessary should be made in consideration that a physician or allowed \npractitioner has determined that the services ordered are reasonable and necessary.  The \nservices must, therefore, be viewed from the perspective of the condition of the patient \nwhen the services were ordered and what was, at that time, reasonably expected to be \nappropriate treatment for the illness or injury throughout the certification period. \n \nA patient's overall medical condition, without regard to whether the illness or injury is \nacute, chronic, terminal, or expected to extend over a long period of time, should be \nconsidered in deciding whether skilled services are needed.  A patient's diagnosis should \nnever be the sole factor in deciding that a service the patient needs is either skilled or not \nskilled.  Skilled care may, depending on the unique condition of the patient, continue to \nbe necessary for patients whose condition is stable. \nAs is outlined in home health regulations, as part of the home health agency (HHA) \nConditions of Participation (CoPs), the clinical record of the patient must contain \nprogress and clinical notes.  Additionally, in Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing \nManual, Chapter 10; \u201cHome Health Agency Billing\u201d, instructions specify that for each \nclaim, HHAs are required to report all services provided to the beneficiary during each \n30-day period, which includes reporting each visit in line-item detail.

These clinical notes are also expected to provide important \ncommunication among all members of the home care team regarding the development, \ncourse and outcomes of the skilled observations, assessments, treatment and training \nperformed.  Taken as a whole then, the clinical notes are expected to tell the story of the \npatient\u2019s achievement towards his/her goals as outlined in the Plan of Care.  In this way, \nthe notes will serve to demonstrate why a skilled service is needed. \n \nTherefore the home health clinical notes must document as appropriate: \n \n\u2022 the history and physical exam pertinent to the day\u2019s visit, (including the response or \nchanges in behavior to previously administered skilled services) and the skilled \nservices applied on the current visit, and \n \n\u2022 the patient/caregiver\u2019s response to the skilled services provided, and "

Where these signs and symptoms are such that there is a reasonable potential \nthat skilled observation and assessment by a licensed nurse will result in changes to the \ntreatment of the patient, then the services would be covered.  However, observation and \nassessment by a nurse is not reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the illness or \ninjury where fluctuating signs and symptoms are part of a longstanding pattern of the \npatient's condition which has not previously required a change in the prescribed \ntreatment. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nA patient with atherosclerotic heart disease with congestive heart failure requires \nobservation by skilled nursing personnel for signs of decompensation or adverse effects \nresulting from newly prescribed medication.

Where the teaching or training is reasonable and necessary to \nthe treatment of the illness or injury, skilled nursing visits for teaching would be covered.  \nThe test of whether a nursing service is skilled relates to the skill required to teach and \nnot to the nature of what is being taught.  Therefore, where skilled nursing services are \nnecessary to teach an unskilled service, the teaching may be covered.  Skilled nursing \nvisits for teaching and training activities are reasonable and necessary where the teaching \nor training is appropriate to the patient's functional loss, illness, or injury. \n \nWhere it becomes apparent after a reasonable period of time that the patient, family, or \ncaregiver will not or is not able to be trained, then further teaching and training would \ncease to be reasonable and necessary.  The reason why the training was unsuccessful \nshould be documented in the record.  Notwithstanding that the teaching or training was \nunsuccessful, the services for teaching and training would be considered to be reasonable \nand necessary prior to the point that it became apparent that the teaching or training was \nunsuccessful, as long as such services were appropriate to the patient's illness, functional \nloss, or injury. \n \nIn determining the reasonable and necessary number of teaching and training visits, \nconsideration must be given to whether the teaching and training provided constitutes \nreinforcement of teaching provided previously in an institutional setting or in the home or \nwhether it represents initial instruction.  Where the teaching represents initial instruction, \nthe complexity of the activity to be taught and the unique abilities of the patient are to be \nconsidered.  Where the teaching constitutes reinforcement, an analysis of the patient's \nretained knowledge and anticipated learning progress is necessary to determine the \nappropriate number of visits.  Skills taught in a controlled institutional setting often need \nto be reinforced when the patient returns home.  Where the patient needs reinforcement \nof the institutional teaching, additional teaching visits in the home are covered. \n \nRe-teaching or retraining for an appropriate period may be considered reasonable and \nnecessary where there is a change in the procedure or the patient's condition that requires \nre-teaching, or where the patient, family, or caregiver is not properly carrying out the \ntask.  The medical record should document the reason that the re-teaching or retraining is \nrequired and the patient/caregiver response to the education. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nA physician has ordered skilled nursing care for teaching a diabetic who has recently \nbecome insulin dependent.  The physician has ordered teaching of self-injection and \nmanagement of insulin, signs, and symptoms of insulin shock, and actions to take in \nemergencies.  The education is reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the illness or \ninjury, and the teaching services and the patient/caregiver responses must be documented. "

In monitoring phenytoin (e.g., Dilantin) administration, the difference \nbetween a therapeutic and a toxic level of phenytoin in the blood is very \nslight and it is therefore appropriate to monitor the level on a routine basis \n(every 3 months) when the results are stable and the patient is \nasymptomatic. \n \nc.

To be covered, the services must \nbe reasonable and necessary skilled nursing care and must be performed under the \ngeneral supervision of a registered or licensed nurse.

Psychiatrically trained nurses are nurses who have special training and/or \nexperience beyond the standard curriculum required for a registered nurse.  The services \nof the psychiatric nurse are to be provided under a plan of care established and reviewed \nby a physician or allowed practitioner.  \n  \nBecause the law precludes agencies that primarily provide care and treatment of mental \ndiseases from participating as HHAs, psychiatric nursing must be furnished by an agency \nthat does not primarily provide care and treatment of mental diseases.  If a substantial \nnumber of an HHA's patients attend partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient \nprograms or receive other outpatient mental health services, the Medicare contractor will \nverify whether the patients meet the eligibility requirements specified in \u00a730 and whether \nthe HHA is primarily engaged in care and treatment of mental disease.  \n  \nServices of a psychiatric nurse would not be considered reasonable and necessary to \nassess or monitor use of psychoactive drugs that are being used for non-psychiatric \ndiagnoses or to monitor the condition of a patient with a known psychiatric illness who is \non treatment but is considered stable.  A person on treatment would be considered stable \nif their symptoms were absent or minimal or if symptoms were present but were \nrelatively stable and did not create a significant disruption in the patient's normal living \nsituation.  \n  \nEXAMPLE 1:  \n  \nA patient is homebound for medical conditions, but has a psychiatric condition for which \nhe has been receiving medication.  The patient's psychiatric condition has not required a \nchange in medication or hospitalization for over 2 years.

In most instances, this \ndefinition will be met if a patient requires a skilled nursing service at least once every 60 \ndays.  The exception to the intermittent requirement is daily skilled nursing services for \ndiabetics unable to administer their insulin (when there is no able and willing caregiver). \n \nSince the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing care makes the patient eligible for other \ncovered home health services, the Medicare contractor should evaluate each claim \ninvolving skilled nursing services furnished less frequently than once every 60 days.  In \nsuch cases, payment should be made only if documentation justifies a recurring need for \nreasonable, necessary, and medically predictable skilled nursing services.  The following \nare examples of the need for infrequent, yet intermittent, skilled nursing services: \n \n1. The patient with an indwelling silicone  catheter who generally needs a catheter \nchange only at 90-day intervals; \n \n2. The patient who experiences a fecal impaction (i.e., loss of bowel tone, restrictive \nmobility, and a breakdown in good health habits) and must receive care to \nmanually relieve the impaction.  Although these impactions are likely to recur, it \nis not possible to pinpoint a specific timeframe; or \n \n3. The blind diabetic who self- injects insulin may have a medically predictable \nrecurring need for a skilled nursing visit at least every 90 days.  These visits, for \nexample, would be to observe and determine the need for changes in the level and \ntype of care which have been prescribed thus supplementing the physician or \nallowed practitioner's contacts with the patient. \n \nThere is a possibility that a physician or allowed practitioner may order a skilled visit less \nfrequently than once every 60 days for an eligible beneficiary if there exists an \nextraordinary circumstance of anticipated patient need that is documented in the patient's \nplan of care in accordance with 42 CFR 409.43(b)\n.  A skilled visit frequency of less than \nonce every 60 days would only be covered if it is specifically ordered by a physician or \nallowed practitioner in the patient's plan of care and is considered to be a reasonable, \nnecessary, and medically predictable skilled need for the patient in the individual \ncircumstance. \n \nWhere the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing visits is medically predictable but a \nsituation arises after the first visit making additional visits unnecessary, e.g., the patient is \ninstitutionalized or dies, the one visit would be paid at the wage-adjusted LUPA amount \nfor that discipline type.  However, a one-time order; e.g., to give gamma globulin \nfollowing exposure to hepatitis, would not be considered a need for \"intermittent\" skilled \nnursing care since a recurrence of the problem that would require this service is not \nmedically predictable. \n \nAlthough most patients require services no more frequently than several times a week, \nMedicare will pay for part-time (as defined in \u00a750.7\n) medically reasonable and necessary \nskilled nursing care 7 days a week for a short period of time (2 to 3 weeks).

Skilled \nrehabilitation services concurrent with the management of a patient's care plan include \nobjective tests and measurements such as, but not limited to, range of motion, strength, \nbalance, coordination, endurance, or functional ability. \n \nAs described in section 40.2.1(b), at defined points during a course of therapy, the \nqualified physical therapist (instead of an assistant) must perform the ordered therapy \nservice visit, assess the patient\u2019s function using a method which allows for objective \nmeasurement of function and comparison of successive measurements, and document the \nresults of the assessments, corresponding measurements, and effectiveness of the therapy \nin the patient\u2019s clinical record.  Refer to \u00a740.2.1(b) for specific timing and documentation \nrequirements associated with these requirements. \n \nB.  Therapeutic Exercises \n \nTherapeutic exercises, which require the skills of a qualified physical therapist to ensure \nthe safety of the beneficiary and the effectiveness of the treatment constitute skilled \nphysical therapy, when the criteria in \u00a740.2.1(d) above are met. \n \nC.  Gait Training \n \nGait evaluation and training furnished to a patient whose ability to walk has been \nimpaired by neurological, muscular or skeletal abnormality require the skills of a \nqualified physical therapist and constitute skilled physical therapy and are considered \nreasonable and necessary if they can be expected to materially improve or maintain the \npatient's ability to walk or prevent or slow further deterioration of the patient\u2019s ability to \nwalk.  Gait evaluation and training which is furnished to a patient whose ability to walk \nhas been impaired by a condition other than a neurological, muscular, or skeletal \nabnormality would nevertheless be covered where physical therapy is reasonable and \nnecessary to restore or maintain function or to prevent or slow further deterioration. Refer \nto \u00a740.2.1(d)(1) for the reasonable and necessary coverage criteria associated with \nrestoring patient function. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nA physician has ordered gait evaluation and training for a patient whose gait has been \nmaterially impaired by scar tissue resulting from burns.

At appropriate intervals (see above), the qualified therapist \nmust assess the patient with objective measurements of function. \n \nEXAMPLE 2: \n \nA patient who has had a total hip replacement is ambulatory but demonstrates weakness \nand is unable to climb stairs safely.  Physical therapy would be reasonable and necessary \nto teach the patient to climb and descend stairs safely.  Once the patient has reached the \ngoal of climbing and descending stairs safely, additional therapy services are no longer \nrequired, and thus would not be covered. \n \nEXAMPLE 3: \n \nA patient who has received gait training has reached their maximum restoration potential, \nand the physical therapist is teaching the patient and family how to safely perform the \nactivities that are a part of the maintenance program.  The visits by the physical therapist \nto demonstrate and teach the activities (which by themselves do not require the skills of a \ntherapist) would be covered since they are needed to establish the program (refer to \n\u00a740.2.1(d)(2)).  The patient\u2019s and caregiver\u2019s understanding and implementation of the \nmaintenance program must be documented.  After the establishment of the maintenance \nprogram, any further visits would need to document why the skilled services of a physical \ntherapist are still required. \n \nD.  Range of Motion \n \nOnly a qualified physical therapist may perform range of motion tests and, therefore, \nsuch tests are skilled physical therapy. \n \nRange of motion exercises constitute skilled physical therapy only if they are part of an \nactive treatment for a specific disease state, illness, or injury that has resulted in a loss or \nrestriction of mobility (as evidenced by physical therapy notes showing the degree of \nmotion lost and the degree to be restored).  Unskilled individuals may provide range of \nmotion exercises unrelated to the restoration of a specific loss of function often safely and \neffectively.  Passive exercises to maintain range of motion in paralyzed extremities that \ncan be carried out by unskilled persons do not constitute skilled physical therapy. \n \nHowever, if the criteria in \u00a740.2\n.1(d)(3) are met, where there is clear documentation that, \nbecause of special medical complications (e.g., susceptible to pathological bone \nfractures), the skills of a therapist are needed to provide services which ordinarily do not \nneed the skills of a therapist, and then the services would be covered. \n \nE.

The initial evaluation of the patient's \nneeds, the designing of a maintenance program appropriate to the patient\u2019s capacity and \ntolerance and to the treatment objectives of the physician, the instruction of the patient, \nfamily or caregivers to carry out the program safely and effectively, and such \nreevaluations as may be required by the patient's condition, would constitute skilled \nphysical therapy.  Each component of this process must be documented in the home \nhealth record. \n \nWhile a patient is under a restorative physical therapy program, the physical therapist \nshould regularly reevaluate the patient's condition and adjust any exercise program the \npatient is expected to carry out alone or with the aid of supportive personnel to maintain \nthe function being restored.  Consequently, by the time it is determined that no further \nrestoration is possible (i.e., by the end of the last restorative session) the physical \ntherapist will already have designed the maintenance program required and instructed the \npatient or caregivers in carrying out the program. \n \nF.  Ultrasound, Shortwave, and Microwave Diathermy Treatments \n \nThese treatments must always be performed by or under the supervision of a qualified \nphysical therapist and are skilled therapy. \n \nG.

The Law \n \nThe Medicare law governing the home health PPS is specific to the type of items and \nservices bundled to the HHA and the time the services are bundled.  Medical supplies are \nbundled while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  If a patient is admitted for \na condition which is related to a chronic condition that requires a medical supply (e.g., \nostomy patient) the HHA is required to provide the medical supply while the patient is \nunder a home health plan of care during a 30-day period of care.  The physician or \nallowed practitioner\u2019s orders in the plan of care must reflect all nonroutine medical \nsupplies provided and used while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  The \nconsolidated billing requirement is not superseded by the exclusion of certain medical \nsupplies from the plan of care and then distinguishing between medical supplies that are \nrelated and unrelated to the plan of care.  Failure to include medical supplies on the plan \nof care does not relieve HHAs from the obligation to comply with the consolidated \nbilling requirements.  The comprehensive nature of the current patient assessment and \nplan of care requirements looks at the totality of patient needs.  However, there could be a \ncircumstance where a physician or allowed practitioner could be uncomfortable with \nwriting orders for a preexisting condition unrelated to the reason for home health care.  In \nthose circumstances, PRN orders for such supplies may be used in the plan of care by a \nphysician or allowed practitioner. \n \nThus, all medical supplies are bundled while the patient is under a home health plan of \ncare.  This includes, but is not limited to, the above listed medical supplies as well as the \nPart B items provided in the final PPS rule.  The latter item lists are subsequently updated \nin accordance with the current process governing the deletion, replacement and revision \nof Medicare Part B codes.  Parenteral and enteral nutrition, prosthetics, orthotics, DME \nand DME supplies are not considered medical supplies and therefore not subject to \nbundling while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  However, \u00a71834(h)(4)(c)\n \nof the Act specifically excludes from the term \"orthotics and prosthetics\" medical \nsupplies including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags and supplies related to \nostomy care furnished by an HHA under \n\u00a71861(m) of the Act.  Therefore, these items are \nbundled while a patient is under a home health plan of care. \n \nB.  Relationship Between Patient Choice and Veterans Benefits \n \nFor veterans, both Medicare and Veteran's Administration (VA) benefits are primary.  \nTherefore, the beneficiary who is a veteran has some choices in cases where the benefits \noverlap.  The beneficiary, however, must select one or the other program as primary \nwhen obtaining active care.  If the VA is selected as primary for home health care, then \nMedicare becomes a secondary payer. An HHA must provide the medical supplies a "

If a patient has medical supplies provided by the VA \nbecause of the patient's preference, then the HHA must not duplicate the supplies under \nMedicare.  The beneficiary's choice is controlling.  The HHA may not require the \nbeneficiary to obtain or use medical supplies covered by the primary payer from any \nother source, including the VA. \n \nC.  Medical Supplies Purchased by the Patient Prior to the Start of Care \n \nA patient may have acquired medical supplies prior to his/her Medicare home health start \nof care date.  If a patient prefers to use his or her own medical supplies after having been \noffered appropriate supplies by the HHA and it is determined by the HHA that the \npatient's medical supplies are clinically appropriate, then the patient's choice is \ncontrolling.  The HHA is not required to duplicate the medical supplies if the patient \nelects to use his or her own medical supplies.  However, if the patient prefers to have the \nHHA provide medical supplies while the patient is under a Medicare home health plan of \ncare, then the HHA must provide the medical supplies.  The HHA may not require that \nthe patient obtain or use medical supplies from any other source.  Given the possibility of \nsubsequent misunderstandings arising between the HHA and the patient on this issue, the \nHHA should document the beneficiary's decision to decline HHA furnished medical \nsupplies and use their own resources. \n \n50.4.1.2 - Routine Supplies (Nonreportable) \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) \n \nRoutine supplies are supplies that are customarily used in small quantities during the \ncourse of most home care visits.

The law does not permit the substitution or \nuse of a telecommunications system to provide any covered home health services paid \nunder the home health PPS, or any covered home health service paid outside of the home \nhealth PPS.  As stated in 42 CFR 409.48(c)\n, a visit is an episode of personal contact with \nthe beneficiary by staff of the home health agency (HHA), or others under arrangements \nwith the HHA for the purposes of providing a covered service. The provision clarifies \nthat there is nothing to preclude an HHA from adopting telemedicine or other \ntechnologies that they believe promote efficiencies, but there is no separate \nreimbursement for those technologies under the Medicare home health benefit. However, \nMedicare does recognize services furnished via telecommunications technology (see \nsection 80.10) as an allowed administrative cost on Medicare cost reports if \ntelecommunications technology is used by the HHA to augment the care planning \nprocess, and the technology is indicated on the plan of care.  \n \nThis provision does not waive the current statutory requirement for a physician or \nallowed practitioner certification of a home health plan of care under current \n\u00a7\u00a71814(a)(2)(C) or 1835(a)(2)(A)\n of the Act. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTransmittals Issued for this Chapter "

The hospital wage index is adjusted to \naccount for the geographic reclassification of hospitals in accordance with \n\u00a7\u00a71886(d)(8)(B) and 1886(d)(10)\n of the Social Security Act (the Act.)  According to the \nlaw, geographic reclassification only applies to hospitals.  Additionally, the hospital wage \nindex has specific floors that are required by law.  Because these reclassifications and \nfloors do not apply to HHAs, the home health rates are adjusted by the pre-floor and pre-\nreclassified hospital wage index. \n \nNOTE: The pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index varies slightly from the \nnumbers published in the Medicare inpatient hospital PPS regulation that reflects the \nfloor and reclassification adjustments.

The partial \npayment adjustment will be calculated by using the span of days (first billable service \ndate through and including the last billable service date) under the original plan of care as \na proportion of the 30-day period. The proportion will then be multiplied by the original \ncase-mix and wage index to produce the 30-day payment. \n \nC.  Common Ownership Exception to Partial Payment Adjustment \n \nThe partial payment adjustment does not apply in situations of transfers among HHAs of \ncommon ownership.  Those situations would be considered services provided under \narrangement on behalf of the originating HHA by the receiving HHA with the ownership \ninterest until the end of the 30-day period.  The common ownership exception to the \ntransfer partial payment adjustment does not apply if the beneficiary moved out of their \nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or non-MSA during the 30-day period before the \ntransfer to the receiving HHA. \n \nD.  Beneficiary Elected Transfer Verification \n \nIn order for a receiving HHA to accept a beneficiary elected transfer, the receiving HHA \nmust document that the beneficiary has been informed that the initial HHA will no longer \nreceive Medicare payment on behalf of the patient and will no longer provide Medicare \ncovered services to the patient after the date of the patient's elected transfer in accordance \nwith current patient rights requirements at 42 CFR 484.50(d)\n.  The receiving HHA must \nalso document in the record that it accessed the Medicare contractor\u2019s inquiry system to \ndetermine whether or not the patient was under an established home health plan of care \nand it must contact the initial HHA on the effective date of transfer.  In the rare \ncircumstance of a dispute between HHAs, the Medicare contractor is responsible for \nworking with both HHAs to resolve the dispute. If the receiving HHA can provide \ndocumentation of its notice of patient rights on Medicare payment liability provided to \nthe patient upon transfer and its contact of the initial HHA of the transfer date, then the \ninitial HHA will be ineligible for payment for the period of overlap in addition to the \nappropriate partial payment adjustment.  If the receiving HHA cannot provide the \nappropriate documentation, the receiving HHA's RAP and/or final claim will be \ncancelled, and full period payment will be provided to the initial HHA.  For the receiving \nHHA to properly document that it contacted the initial HHA on the effective date of \ntransfer it must maintain similar information as the initial HHA, including the same basic \nbeneficiary information, personnel contacted, dates and times.  The initial HHA must also \nproperly document that it was contacted and it accepted the transfer.  Where it disputes a \ntransfer, the initial HHA must call its Medicare contractor to resolve the dispute.  The \nMedicare contractor is responsible for working with both HHAs to resolve the dispute.

Outlier payments can result from medically necessary high \nutilization in any or all-home health service disciplines.  CMS makes outlier payments \nwhen the cost of care exceeds a threshold dollar amount.  The outlier threshold for each \ncase-mix group is the 30-day period payment amount for that group or the partial \npayment adjustment amount for the 30-day period, plus a fixed dollar loss amount, which \nis the same for all case-mix groups.  The outlier payment is a proportion of the amount of \nimputed costs beyond the threshold.  CMS calculates the imputed cost for each 30-day \nperiod by first taking the national per-visit payment amounts for each discipline and \ncalculating per-unit payment amounts (1 unit = 15 minutes).  The per-unit amounts are \nthen multiplied by the number of units in the discipline and computing the total imputed \ncost for all disciplines (summed across the six disciplines of care). \n \nIf the imputed cost for the 30-day period is greater than the sum of the case-mix and \nwage-adjusted 30-day period payment plus the fixed dollar loss amount (the outlier \nthreshold), a set percentage (the loss sharing ratio) of the difference between the imputed \namount and outlier threshold will be paid to the HHA as a wage-adjusted outlier payment \nin addition to the 30-day period payment. \n \nThe amount of the outlier payment is determined as follows: \n \n1. Calculate the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment (including non-\nroutine supplies (NRS)); \n \n2. Add the wage-adjusted fixed dollar loss amount.  The sum of steps 1 and 2 is the \noutlier threshold for the 30-day period; \n \n3. Calculate the wage-adjusted imputed cost of the 30-day period by first \nmultiplying the total number of units for each home health discipline by the \nnational per unit amounts, and wage-adjusting those amounts.  Sum the per \ndiscipline wage-adjusted imputed amounts to yield the total wage-adjusted \nimputed cost for the 30-day period; \n \n4. Subtract the total imputed cost for the 30-day period (total from Step 3) from the \nsum of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment and the wage-\nadjusted fixed dollar loss amount (sum of Steps 1 and 2 - outlier threshold); \n \n5. Multiply the difference by the loss sharing ratio; and \n \n6. That total amount is the outlier payment for the 30-day period. \nEffective January 1, 2010, an outlier cap precludes any HHA from receiving more than 10 \npercent of their total home health payment in outliers.

Therefore, \na patient is entitled to have the costs of reasonable and necessary services reimbursed by \nMedicare without regard to whether there is someone available to furnish the services.  \nHowever, where a family member or other person is or will be providing services that \nadequately meet the patient's needs, it would not be reasonable and necessary for HHA \npersonnel to furnish such services.  Ordinarily it can be presumed that there is no able \nand willing person in the home to provide the services being rendered by the HHA unless \nthe patient or family indicates otherwise and objects to the provision of the services by \nthe HHA, or unless the HHA has first hand knowledge to the contrary. \n \nSimilarly, a patient is entitled to reasonable and necessary Medicare home health services \neven if the patient would qualify for institutional care (e.g., hospital care or skilled \nnursing facility care) and Medicare payment should be made for reasonable and \nnecessary home health services where the patient is also receiving supplemental services \nthat do not meet Medicare\u2019s definition of skilled nursing care or home health aide \nservices. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nA patient who lives with an adult daughter and otherwise qualifies for Medicare coverage \nof home health services, requires the assistance of a home health aide for bathing and \nassistance with an exercise program to improve endurance.  The daughter is unwilling to \nbathe her elderly father and assist him with the exercise program.  Home health aide \nservices would be reasonable and necessary. \n \nEXAMPLE 2: \n \nA patient who is being discharged from a hospital with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis and \nrequires continuation of the I.V. antibiotic therapy that was begun in the hospital was \nfound to meet the criteria for Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility services.  If \nthe patient also meets the qualifying criteria for coverage of home health services, \npayment may be made for the reasonable and necessary home health services the patient \nneeds, notwithstanding the availability of coverage in a skilled nursing facility. \n \nEXAMPLE 3: \n \nA patient who needs skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis also hires a licensed \npractical (vocational) nurse to provide nighttime assistance while family members sleep.  \nThe care provided by the nurse, as respite to the family members, does not require the "

(See \n\u00a750.6\n.)  However, even in these situations, for the services to be covered as home health \nservices the patient must be considered confined to home and meet both criteria listed \nabove. \n \nIf a question is raised as to whether a patient is confined to the home, the HHA will be \nrequested to furnish the Medicare contractor with the information necessary to establish \nthat the patient is homebound as defined above. \n \n \n30.1.2 - Patient's Place of Residence \n(Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20) \n \nA patient's residence is wherever he or she makes his or her home.  This may be his or \nher own dwelling, an apartment, a relative's home, a home for the aged, or some other \ntype of institution.  However, an institution may not be considered a patient's residence if \nthe institution meets the requirements of \u00a7\u00a71861(e)(1) or 1819(a)(1)\n of the Act..  \nIncluded in this group are hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, as well as most nursing \nfacilities under Medicaid.

When a patient \nremains in a participating SNF following their discharge from active care, the facility \nmay not be considered their residence for purposes of home health coverage. \n \nA patient may have more than one home and the Medicare rules do not prohibit a patient \nfrom having one or more places of residence.  A patient, under a Medicare home health \nplan of care, who resides in more than one place of residence during a period of Medicare \ncovered home health services will not disqualify the patient's homebound status for \npurposes of eligibility.  For example, a person may reside in a principal home and also a \nsecond vacation home, mobile home, or the home of a caretaker relative.  The fact that \nthe patient resides in more than one home and, as a result, must transit from one to the \nother, is not in itself, an indication that the patient is not homebound.  The requirements \nof homebound must be met at each location (i.e., the patient must meet both criteria listed \nin section 30.1.1 above). \n \nA.  Assisted Living Facilities, Group Homes, and Personal Care Homes \n \nAn individual may be \"confined to the home\" for purposes of Medicare coverage of home \nhealth services if he or she resides in an institution that is not primarily engaged in \nproviding to inpatients: \n \n\u2022 Diagnostic and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis; \n \n\u2022 Treatment; \n \n\u2022 Care of injured, disabled or sick persons; \n \n\u2022 Rehabilitation services or other skilled services needed to maintain a patient\u2019s \ncurrent condition or to prevent or slow further deterioration; or \n \n\u2022 Skilled nursing care or related services for patients who require medical or \nnursing care. \nIf it is determined that the assisted living facility (also called personal care homes, group \nhomes, etc.) in which the individuals reside are not primarily engaged in providing the \nabove services, then Medicare will cover reasonable and necessary home health care \nfurnished to these individuals. \n \nIf it is determined that the services furnished by the home health agency are duplicative \nof services furnished by an assisted living facility when provision of such care is required \nof the facility under State licensure requirements, claims for such services should be \ndenied under \u00a71862(a)(1)(A)\n of the Act.  Section 1862(a)(1)(A) excludes services that are \nnot necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the \nfunctioning of a malformed body member from Medicare coverage.

An individual's choice to reside in such a facility is also a choice \nto accept the services it holds itself out as offering to its patients. \n \nB.  Day Care Centers and Patient's Place of Residence \n \nThe current statutory definition of homebound or confined does not imply that Medicare \ncoverage has been expanded to include adult day care services. \n \nThe law does not permit an HHA to furnish a Medicare covered billable visit to a patient \nunder a home health plan of care outside his or her home, except in those limited \ncircumstances where the patient needs to use medical equipment that is too cumbersome \nto bring to the home.  Section 1861(m) of the Act stipulates that home health services \nprovided to a patient be provided to the patient on a visiting basis in a place of residence \nused as the individual's home.  A licensed/certified day care center does not meet the \ndefinition of a place of residence. \n \nC.  State Licensure/Certification of Day Care Facilities \n \nPer Section 1861(m)\n of the Act, an adult day care center must be either licensed or \ncertified by the State or accredited by a private accrediting body.  State licensure or \ncertification as an adult day care facility must be based on State interpretations of its \nprocess.  For example, several States do not license adult day care facilities as a whole, \nbut do certify some entities as Medicaid certified centers for purposes of providing adult \nday care under the Medicaid home and community based waiver program.  It is the \nresponsibility of the State to determine the necessary criteria for \"State certification\" in \nsuch a situation.  A State could determine that Medicaid certification is an acceptable \nstandard and consider its Medicaid certified adult day care facilities to be \"State \ncertified.\"  On the other hand, a State could determine Medicaid certification to be \ninsufficient and require other conditions to be met before the adult day care facility is \nconsidered \"State certified\". \n \nD.  Determination of the Therapeutic, Medical or Psychosocial Treatment of the \nPatient at the Day Care Facility \n \nIt is not the obligation of the HHA to determine whether the adult day care facility is \nproviding psychosocial treatment, but only to assure that the adult day care center is \nlicensed/certified by the State or accrediting body.  The intent of the law, in extending the \nhomebound exception status to attendance at such adult day care facilities, recognizes \nthat they ordinarily furnish psychosocial services. \n \n30.2 - Services Are Provided Under a Plan of Care Established and \nApproved by a Physician or Allowed Practitioner                                  \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) "

The \npatient's need for occupational therapy qualifies him for home health services, including \nhome health aide services (presuming that all other qualifying criteria are met), because \nin the prior certification period the beneficiary\u2019s eligibility for home health services was \nestablished by virtue of prior needs for physical therapy and speech-language pathology, \nand occupational therapy was initiated while the patient still required physical therapy \nand/or speech language-pathology. \n \n30.5 - Physician or Allowed Practitioner Certification and \nRecertification of Patient Eligibility for Medicare Home Health Services                    \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) \n \nThe HHA must be acting upon a plan of care as described in \u00a730.2, and a physician or \nallowed practitioner certification or recertification that meets the requirements of the \nfollowing sections in order for HHA services to be covered. \n \n30.5.1 - Physician or Allowed Practitioner Certification \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) \n \nA certification (versus recertification) is considered to be anytime that a Start of Care \nOASIS is completed to initiate care.

Skilled care may, depending on the unique condition of the patient, continue to \nbe necessary for patients whose condition is stable. \nAs is outlined in home health regulations, as part of the home health agency (HHA) \nConditions of Participation (CoPs), the clinical record of the patient must contain \nprogress and clinical notes.  Additionally, in Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing \nManual, Chapter 10; \u201cHome Health Agency Billing\u201d, instructions specify that for each \nclaim, HHAs are required to report all services provided to the beneficiary during each \n30-day period, which includes reporting each visit in line-item detail.  As such, it is \nexpected that the home health records for every visit will reflect the need for the skilled \nmedical care provided.  These clinical notes are also expected to provide important \ncommunication among all members of the home care team regarding the development, \ncourse and outcomes of the skilled observations, assessments, treatment and training \nperformed.  Taken as a whole then, the clinical notes are expected to tell the story of the \npatient\u2019s achievement towards his/her goals as outlined in the Plan of Care.  In this way, \nthe notes will serve to demonstrate why a skilled service is needed. \n \nTherefore the home health clinical notes must document as appropriate: \n \n\u2022 the history and physical exam pertinent to the day\u2019s visit, (including the response or \nchanges in behavior to previously administered skilled services) and the skilled \nservices applied on the current visit, and \n \n\u2022 the patient/caregiver\u2019s response to the skilled services provided, and "

Where these signs and symptoms are such that there is a reasonable potential \nthat skilled observation and assessment by a licensed nurse will result in changes to the \ntreatment of the patient, then the services would be covered.  However, observation and \nassessment by a nurse is not reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the illness or \ninjury where fluctuating signs and symptoms are part of a longstanding pattern of the \npatient's condition which has not previously required a change in the prescribed \ntreatment. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nA patient with atherosclerotic heart disease with congestive heart failure requires \nobservation by skilled nursing personnel for signs of decompensation or adverse effects \nresulting from newly prescribed medication.  Skilled observation is needed to determine \nwhether the new drug regimen should be modified or whether other therapeutic measures \nshould be considered until the patient's clinical condition and/or treatment regimen has \nstabilized.  The clinical notes for each home health visit should reflect the deliberations \nand their outcome. \n \nEXAMPLE 2: \n \nA patient has undergone peripheral vascular disease treatment including a \nrevascularization procedure (bypass).

Since the combination of the patient's condition, age, and \nimmobility create a high potential for serious complications, such an understanding is \nessential to ensure the patient's recovery and safety.  The management of this plan of care \nrequires skilled nursing personnel until nursing visits are not needed to observe and \nassess the effects of the non-skilled services being provided to treat the illness or injury \nuntil the patient recovers.

Therefore, where skilled nursing services are \nnecessary to teach an unskilled service, the teaching may be covered.  Skilled nursing \nvisits for teaching and training activities are reasonable and necessary where the teaching \nor training is appropriate to the patient's functional loss, illness, or injury. \n \nWhere it becomes apparent after a reasonable period of time that the patient, family, or \ncaregiver will not or is not able to be trained, then further teaching and training would \ncease to be reasonable and necessary.

Where the teaching represents initial instruction, \nthe complexity of the activity to be taught and the unique abilities of the patient are to be \nconsidered.  Where the teaching constitutes reinforcement, an analysis of the patient's \nretained knowledge and anticipated learning progress is necessary to determine the \nappropriate number of visits.  Skills taught in a controlled institutional setting often need \nto be reinforced when the patient returns home.  Where the patient needs reinforcement \nof the institutional teaching, additional teaching visits in the home are covered. \n \nRe-teaching or retraining for an appropriate period may be considered reasonable and \nnecessary where there is a change in the procedure or the patient's condition that requires \nre-teaching, or where the patient, family, or caregiver is not properly carrying out the \ntask.

More frequent injections would be appropriate \nin the initial or acute phase of the disease until it has been determined through \nlaboratory tests that the patient can be sustained on a maintenance dose. \n \n2.  Insulin Injections \n \nInsulin is customarily self-injected by patients or is injected by their families.  \nHowever, where a patient is either physically or mentally unable to self-inject \ninsulin and there is no other person who is able and willing to inject the patient, \nthe injections would be considered a reasonable and necessary skilled nursing \nservice. \n \nEXAMPLE:  A patient who requires an injection of insulin once per day for treatment of \ndiabetes mellitus, also has multiple sclerosis with loss of muscle control in the arms and \nhands, occasional tremors, and vision loss that causes inability to fill syringes or self-\ninject insulin.  If there weren't an able and willing caregiver to inject her insulin, skilled \nnursing care would be reasonable and necessary for the injection of the insulin. \n \nThe prefilling of syringes with insulin (or other medication that is self-injected) does not \nrequire the skills of a licensed nurse and, therefore, is not considered to be a skilled \nnursing service.  If the patient needs someone only to prefill syringes (and therefore \nneeds no skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis, physical therapy, or speech-\nlanguage pathology services), the patient, therefore, does not qualify for any Medicare \ncoverage of home health care.  Prefilling of syringes for self-administration of insulin or \nother medications is considered to be assistance with medications that are ordinarily self-\nadministered and is an appropriate home health aide service.  (See \u00a750.2\n.)  However, \nwhere State law requires that a licensed nurse prefill syringes, a skilled nursing visit to \nprefill syringes is paid as a skilled nursing visit (if the patient otherwise needs skilled \nnursing care, physical therapy, or speech-language pathology services), but is not \nconsidered to be a skilled nursing service. \n \nB.  Oral Medications \n \nThe administration of oral medications by a nurse is not reasonable and necessary skilled \nnursing care except in the specific situation in which the complexity of the patient's \ncondition, the nature of the drugs prescribed, and the number of drugs prescribed require \nthe skills of a licensed nurse to detect and evaluate side effects or reactions.  The medical \nrecord must document the specific circumstances that cause administration of an oral \nmedication to require skilled observation and assessment. \n "

The physician has ordered skilled nursing visits once per month to change the \ncatheter, and has left a \"PRN\" order for up to three additional visits per month for skilled \nobservation and evaluation and/or catheter changes if the patient or caregiver reports \nsigns and symptoms of a urinary tract infection or a plugged catheter.  During the \ncertification period, the patient's family contacts the HHA because the patient has an \nelevated temperature, abdominal pain, and scant urine output.  The nurse visits the patient \nand determines that the catheter is plugged and there are symptoms of a urinary tract \ninfection.

For skilled nursing care to be \nreasonable and necessary to treat a wound, the size, depth, nature of drainage (color, \nodor, consistency, and quantity), and condition and appearance of the skin surrounding \nthe wound must be documented in the clinical findings so that an assessment of the need \nfor skilled nursing care can be made.  This includes whether wound care is performed via \ndressing changes, NPWT using conventional DME systems or NPWT using a disposable \ndevice.  Coverage or denial of skilled nursing visits for wound care may not be based \nsolely on the stage classification of the wound, but rather must be based on all of the \ndocumented clinical findings.  Moreover, the plan of care must contain the specific \ninstructions for the treatment of the wound.  Where the physician or allowed practitioner \nhas ordered appropriate active treatment (e.g., sterile or complex dressings, NPWT, \nadministration of prescription medications, etc.) of wounds with the following \ncharacteristics, the skills of a licensed nurse are usually reasonable and necessary: \n \n\u2022 Open wounds which are draining purulent or colored exudate or have a foul odor \npresent or for which the patient is receiving antibiotic therapy; \n "

The services \nof the psychiatric nurse are to be provided under a plan of care established and reviewed \nby a physician or allowed practitioner.  \n  \nBecause the law precludes agencies that primarily provide care and treatment of mental \ndiseases from participating as HHAs, psychiatric nursing must be furnished by an agency \nthat does not primarily provide care and treatment of mental diseases.  If a substantial \nnumber of an HHA's patients attend partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient \nprograms or receive other outpatient mental health services, the Medicare contractor will \nverify whether the patients meet the eligibility requirements specified in \u00a730 and whether \nthe HHA is primarily engaged in care and treatment of mental disease.  \n  \nServices of a psychiatric nurse would not be considered reasonable and necessary to \nassess or monitor use of psychoactive drugs that are being used for non-psychiatric \ndiagnoses or to monitor the condition of a patient with a known psychiatric illness who is \non treatment but is considered stable.

In most instances, this \ndefinition will be met if a patient requires a skilled nursing service at least once every 60 \ndays.  The exception to the intermittent requirement is daily skilled nursing services for \ndiabetics unable to administer their insulin (when there is no able and willing caregiver). \n \nSince the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing care makes the patient eligible for other \ncovered home health services, the Medicare contractor should evaluate each claim \ninvolving skilled nursing services furnished less frequently than once every 60 days.  In \nsuch cases, payment should be made only if documentation justifies a recurring need for \nreasonable, necessary, and medically predictable skilled nursing services.  The following \nare examples of the need for infrequent, yet intermittent, skilled nursing services: \n \n1. The patient with an indwelling silicone  catheter who generally needs a catheter \nchange only at 90-day intervals; \n \n2. The patient who experiences a fecal impaction (i.e., loss of bowel tone, restrictive \nmobility, and a breakdown in good health habits) and must receive care to \nmanually relieve the impaction.  Although these impactions are likely to recur, it \nis not possible to pinpoint a specific timeframe; or \n \n3. The blind diabetic who self- injects insulin may have a medically predictable \nrecurring need for a skilled nursing visit at least every 90 days.  These visits, for \nexample, would be to observe and determine the need for changes in the level and \ntype of care which have been prescribed thus supplementing the physician or \nallowed practitioner's contacts with the patient. \n \nThere is a possibility that a physician or allowed practitioner may order a skilled visit less \nfrequently than once every 60 days for an eligible beneficiary if there exists an \nextraordinary circumstance of anticipated patient need that is documented in the patient's \nplan of care in accordance with 42 CFR 409.43(b)\n.  A skilled visit frequency of less than \nonce every 60 days would only be covered if it is specifically ordered by a physician or \nallowed practitioner in the patient's plan of care and is considered to be a reasonable, \nnecessary, and medically predictable skilled need for the patient in the individual \ncircumstance. \n \nWhere the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing visits is medically predictable but a \nsituation arises after the first visit making additional visits unnecessary, e.g., the patient is \ninstitutionalized or dies, the one visit would be paid at the wage-adjusted LUPA amount \nfor that discipline type.  However, a one-time order; e.g., to give gamma globulin \nfollowing exposure to hepatitis, would not be considered a need for \"intermittent\" skilled \nnursing care since a recurrence of the problem that would require this service is not \nmedically predictable. \n \nAlthough most patients require services no more frequently than several times a week, \nMedicare will pay for part-time (as defined in \u00a750.7\n) medically reasonable and necessary \nskilled nursing care 7 days a week for a short period of time (2 to 3 weeks).

Assuming all other eligibility and coverage \nrequirements have been met, skilled occupational therapy services are covered when the \nindividualized assessment of the patient\u2019s clinical condition demonstrates that the \nspecialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a qualified occupational therapist are \nnecessary.

The plan of care established by the HHA nurse sets forth the specific tasks with \nwhich the patient needs assistance.  Home health aide visits at an appropriate frequency \nwould be reasonable and necessary to assist in these tasks. \n \nEXAMPLE 2: \n \nA physician ordered four home health aide visits per week for personal care for a \nmultiple sclerosis patient who is unable to perform these functions because of increasing \ndebilitation.  The home health aide gave the patient a bath twice per week and washed \nhair on the other two visits each week.

Medicare coverage of the administration of insulin \nby a home health aide will depend on whether or not the agency is in compliance with all \nFederal and State laws and regulations related to this task.  However, when the task of \ninsulin administration has been delegated to the home health aide, the task must be \nconsidered and billed as a Medicare home health aide service.

The Law \n \nThe Medicare law governing the home health PPS is specific to the type of items and \nservices bundled to the HHA and the time the services are bundled.  Medical supplies are \nbundled while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  If a patient is admitted for \na condition which is related to a chronic condition that requires a medical supply (e.g., \nostomy patient) the HHA is required to provide the medical supply while the patient is \nunder a home health plan of care during a 30-day period of care.  The physician or \nallowed practitioner\u2019s orders in the plan of care must reflect all nonroutine medical \nsupplies provided and used while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  The \nconsolidated billing requirement is not superseded by the exclusion of certain medical \nsupplies from the plan of care and then distinguishing between medical supplies that are \nrelated and unrelated to the plan of care.  Failure to include medical supplies on the plan \nof care does not relieve HHAs from the obligation to comply with the consolidated \nbilling requirements.  The comprehensive nature of the current patient assessment and \nplan of care requirements looks at the totality of patient needs.  However, there could be a \ncircumstance where a physician or allowed practitioner could be uncomfortable with \nwriting orders for a preexisting condition unrelated to the reason for home health care.  In \nthose circumstances, PRN orders for such supplies may be used in the plan of care by a \nphysician or allowed practitioner. \n \nThus, all medical supplies are bundled while the patient is under a home health plan of \ncare.  This includes, but is not limited to, the above listed medical supplies as well as the \nPart B items provided in the final PPS rule.  The latter item lists are subsequently updated \nin accordance with the current process governing the deletion, replacement and revision \nof Medicare Part B codes.  Parenteral and enteral nutrition, prosthetics, orthotics, DME \nand DME supplies are not considered medical supplies and therefore not subject to \nbundling while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  However, \u00a71834(h)(4)(c)\n \nof the Act specifically excludes from the term \"orthotics and prosthetics\" medical \nsupplies including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags and supplies related to \nostomy care furnished by an HHA under \n\u00a71861(m) of the Act.  Therefore, these items are \nbundled while a patient is under a home health plan of care. \n \nB.  Relationship Between Patient Choice and Veterans Benefits \n \nFor veterans, both Medicare and Veteran's Administration (VA) benefits are primary.  \nTherefore, the beneficiary who is a veteran has some choices in cases where the benefits \noverlap.  The beneficiary, however, must select one or the other program as primary \nwhen obtaining active care.  If the VA is selected as primary for home health care, then \nMedicare becomes a secondary payer. An HHA must provide the medical supplies a "

        "content": "Medicare beneficiary needs no matter the payer; it is not obligated to provide medical \nsupplies that are not needed.  If a patient has medical supplies provided by the VA \nbecause of the patient's preference, then the HHA must not duplicate the supplies under \nMedicare.  The beneficiary's choice is controlling.  The HHA may not require the \nbeneficiary to obtain or use medical supplies covered by the primary payer from any \nother source, including the VA. \n \nC.  Medical Supplies Purchased by the Patient Prior to the Start of Care \n \nA patient may have acquired medical supplies prior to his/her Medicare home health start \nof care date.  If a patient prefers to use his or her own medical supplies after having been \noffered appropriate supplies by the HHA and it is determined by the HHA that the \npatient's medical supplies are clinically appropriate, then the patient's choice is \ncontrolling.  The HHA is not required to duplicate the medical supplies if the patient \nelects to use his or her own medical supplies.  However, if the patient prefers to have the \nHHA provide medical supplies while the patient is under a Medicare home health plan of \ncare, then the HHA must provide the medical supplies.  The HHA may not require that \nthe patient obtain or use medical supplies from any other source.  Given the possibility of \nsubsequent misunderstandings arising between the HHA and the patient on this issue, the \nHHA should document the beneficiary's decision to decline HHA furnished medical \nsupplies and use their own resources. \n \n50.4.1.2 - Routine Supplies (Nonreportable) \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) \n \nRoutine supplies are supplies that are customarily used in small quantities during the \ncourse of most home care visits.  They are usually included in the staff's supplies and not \ndesignated for a specific patient.  These supplies are included in the cost per visit of home \nhealth care services.  Routine supplies would not include those supplies that are \nspecifically ordered by the physician or allowed practitioner or are essential to HHA \npersonnel in order to effectuate the plan of care. \n \nExamples of supplies which are usually considered routine include, but are not limited to: \n \nA.  Dressings and Skin Care \n \n\u2022 Swabs, alcohol preps, and skin prep pads; \n\u2022 Tape removal pads; \n\u2022 Cotton balls; \n\u2022 Adhesive and paper tape; \n\u2022 Nonsterile applicators; and \n\u2022 4 x 4's. \n \nB.

A home health spell of \nillness is a period of consecutive days beginning with the first day not included in a \nprevious home health spell of illness on which the individual is furnished post-\ninstitutional home health services which occurs in a month the individual is entitled to \nPart A.  The home health spell of illness ends with the close of the first period of 60 \nconsecutive days in which the individual is neither an inpatient of a hospital or rural \nprimary care hospital nor an inpatient of a skilled nursing facility (in which the individual \nwas furnished post-hospital extended care services) nor provided home health services. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nAn individual is enrolled in Part A and Part B, qualifies for the Medicare home health \nbenefit, has a three consecutive day stay in a hospital, and is discharged on May 1.  On \nMay 5, the individual receives the first skilled nursing visit under the plan of care.  \nTherefore, post-institutional home health services have been initiated within 14 days of \ndischarge.  The individual is later hospitalized on June 2.  Prior to the June 2 "

If two \nindividuals are present, but only one is needed to provide the care, only one visit may be \ncovered. \n \nA visit is initiated with the delivery of covered home health services and ends at the \nconclusion of delivery of covered home health services.

If an occupational therapist and an occupational therapy assistant visit the patient \ntogether to provide therapy and the therapist is there to supervise the assistant, \none visit is counted. \n \n2.

The beneficiary's location is the \ndetermining factor for the labor adjustment.  The HH PPS rates are adjusted by the pre-\nfloor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index.  The hospital wage index is adjusted to \naccount for the geographic reclassification of hospitals in accordance with \n\u00a7\u00a71886(d)(8)(B) and 1886(d)(10)\n of the Social Security Act (the Act.)  According to the \nlaw, geographic reclassification only applies to hospitals.  Additionally, the hospital wage \nindex has specific floors that are required by law.  Because these reclassifications and \nfloors do not apply to HHAs, the home health rates are adjusted by the pre-floor and pre-\nreclassified hospital wage index. \n \nNOTE: The pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index varies slightly from the \nnumbers published in the Medicare inpatient hospital PPS regulation that reflects the \nfloor and reclassification adjustments.  The wage indices published in the home health \nfinal rule and subsequent annual updates reflect the most recent available pre-floor and \npre-reclassified hospital wage index available at the time of publication. \n \n10.3 - Continuous 60-Day Recertifications \n(Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20) \n \nWhile HH PPS payment is now made for each 30-day period, the home health PPS \npermits continuous 60-day recertifications for patients who continue to be eligible for the \nhome health benefit.  Medicare does not limit the number of continuous 60-day \nrecertifications for beneficiaries who continue to be eligible for the home health benefit.\n \nEach 60-day certification can include two 30-day payment periods. \n \nRecertification is required at least every 60 days when there is a need for continuous \nhome health care after an initial 60-day certification. The recertification visit can be done \nduring the prior certification period.  With some minor exceptions, the Medicare \nConditions of Participation at 42 CFR 484.55(d)(1), require that the recertification \nassessment be done during the last 5 days of the previous certification period (for \nexample, during the initial 60-day certification period, the recertification visit is required \nto be done on days 56-60). \n \n10.4 - Submission of the Notice of Admission (NOA)                               \n(Rev. 11447, Issued: 06-06-22, Effective: 01-01-22, Implementation: 05-26-22) \n \nBeginning January 1, 2022, HHAs will no longer submit Requests for Anticipated \nPayment (RAPs). Instead, for each admission to home health, the HHA notifies Medicare \nsystems via submission of an NOA. The NOA is a one-time submission to establish that \nthe beneficiary is under a home health period of care and trigger home health \nconsolidated billing edits. The NOA covers contiguous 30-day periods of care until the \nindividual is discharged from Medicare home health services. There is no upfront \npayment with the submission of the NOA.  \n "

Methodology Used to Calculate Partial Payment Adjustment \nThe partial payment adjustment for the original 30-day period is calculated to reflect the \nlength of time the beneficiary remained under the care of the original HHA based on the \nfirst billable visit date through and including the last billable visit date.  The partial \npayment adjustment will be calculated by using the span of days (first billable service \ndate through and including the last billable service date) under the original plan of care as \na proportion of the 30-day period. The proportion will then be multiplied by the original \ncase-mix and wage index to produce the 30-day payment. \n \nC.  Common Ownership Exception to Partial Payment Adjustment \n \nThe partial payment adjustment does not apply in situations of transfers among HHAs of \ncommon ownership.  Those situations would be considered services provided under \narrangement on behalf of the originating HHA by the receiving HHA with the ownership \ninterest until the end of the 30-day period.  The common ownership exception to the \ntransfer partial payment adjustment does not apply if the beneficiary moved out of their \nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or non-MSA during the 30-day period before the \ntransfer to the receiving HHA. \n \nD.  Beneficiary Elected Transfer Verification \n \nIn order for a receiving HHA to accept a beneficiary elected transfer, the receiving HHA \nmust document that the beneficiary has been informed that the initial HHA will no longer \nreceive Medicare payment on behalf of the patient and will no longer provide Medicare \ncovered services to the patient after the date of the patient's elected transfer in accordance \nwith current patient rights requirements at 42 CFR 484.50(d)\n.  The receiving HHA must \nalso document in the record that it accessed the Medicare contractor\u2019s inquiry system to \ndetermine whether or not the patient was under an established home health plan of care \nand it must contact the initial HHA on the effective date of transfer.  In the rare \ncircumstance of a dispute between HHAs, the Medicare contractor is responsible for \nworking with both HHAs to resolve the dispute. If the receiving HHA can provide \ndocumentation of its notice of patient rights on Medicare payment liability provided to \nthe patient upon transfer and its contact of the initial HHA of the transfer date, then the \ninitial HHA will be ineligible for payment for the period of overlap in addition to the \nappropriate partial payment adjustment.  If the receiving HHA cannot provide the \nappropriate documentation, the receiving HHA's RAP and/or final claim will be \ncancelled, and full period payment will be provided to the initial HHA.  For the receiving \nHHA to properly document that it contacted the initial HHA on the effective date of \ntransfer it must maintain similar information as the initial HHA, including the same basic \nbeneficiary information, personnel contacted, dates and times.  The initial HHA must also \nproperly document that it was contacted and it accepted the transfer.  Where it disputes a \ntransfer, the initial HHA must call its Medicare contractor to resolve the dispute.  The \nMedicare contractor is responsible for working with both HHAs to resolve the dispute.

Outlier payments can result from medically necessary high \nutilization in any or all-home health service disciplines.  CMS makes outlier payments \nwhen the cost of care exceeds a threshold dollar amount.  The outlier threshold for each \ncase-mix group is the 30-day period payment amount for that group or the partial \npayment adjustment amount for the 30-day period, plus a fixed dollar loss amount, which \nis the same for all case-mix groups.  The outlier payment is a proportion of the amount of \nimputed costs beyond the threshold.  CMS calculates the imputed cost for each 30-day \nperiod by first taking the national per-visit payment amounts for each discipline and \ncalculating per-unit payment amounts (1 unit = 15 minutes).  The per-unit amounts are \nthen multiplied by the number of units in the discipline and computing the total imputed \ncost for all disciplines (summed across the six disciplines of care). \n \nIf the imputed cost for the 30-day period is greater than the sum of the case-mix and \nwage-adjusted 30-day period payment plus the fixed dollar loss amount (the outlier \nthreshold), a set percentage (the loss sharing ratio) of the difference between the imputed \namount and outlier threshold will be paid to the HHA as a wage-adjusted outlier payment \nin addition to the 30-day period payment. \n \nThe amount of the outlier payment is determined as follows: \n \n1. Calculate the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment (including non-\nroutine supplies (NRS)); \n \n2. Add the wage-adjusted fixed dollar loss amount.  The sum of steps 1 and 2 is the \noutlier threshold for the 30-day period; \n \n3. Calculate the wage-adjusted imputed cost of the 30-day period by first \nmultiplying the total number of units for each home health discipline by the \nnational per unit amounts, and wage-adjusting those amounts.  Sum the per \ndiscipline wage-adjusted imputed amounts to yield the total wage-adjusted \nimputed cost for the 30-day period; \n \n4. Subtract the total imputed cost for the 30-day period (total from Step 3) from the \nsum of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment and the wage-\nadjusted fixed dollar loss amount (sum of Steps 1 and 2 - outlier threshold); \n \n5. Multiply the difference by the loss sharing ratio; and \n \n6. That total amount is the outlier payment for the 30-day period. \nEffective January 1, 2010, an outlier cap precludes any HHA from receiving more than 10 \npercent of their total home health payment in outliers.

The 30-day period with visits less \nthan the LUPA threshold for the payment group would be paid at the low \nutilization payment adjusted amount. \n \nB. Patient's Death \n \nThe documented event of a patient's death would result in a full 30-day \nperiod payment, unless the death occurred in a low utilization payment \nadjusted 30-day period. Consistent with all episodes in which a patient \nreceives four or fewer visits, if the patient's death occurred during a low \nutilization adjusted 30-day payment period, the period would be paid at \nthe low utilization payment adjusted amount. In the event of a patient's \ndeath during an adjusted 30-day period, the total adjusted period would \nconstitute the full 30- day period payment.  \n \nC.

However, if the patient becomes subsequently \neligible for the Medicare home health benefit during the same 30- day \nperiod and transferred to another HHA or returned to the same HHA, then \nthis would result in a partial payment adjustment. \n \nD.

Ordinarily it can be presumed that there is no able \nand willing person in the home to provide the services being rendered by the HHA unless \nthe patient or family indicates otherwise and objects to the provision of the services by \nthe HHA, or unless the HHA has first hand knowledge to the contrary. \n \nSimilarly, a patient is entitled to reasonable and necessary Medicare home health services \neven if the patient would qualify for institutional care (e.g., hospital care or skilled \nnursing facility care) and Medicare payment should be made for reasonable and \nnecessary home health services where the patient is also receiving supplemental services \nthat do not meet Medicare\u2019s definition of skilled nursing care or home health aide \nservices. \n \nEXAMPLE 1: \n \nA patient who lives with an adult daughter and otherwise qualifies for Medicare coverage \nof home health services, requires the assistance of a home health aide for bathing and \nassistance with an exercise program to improve endurance.

If \nthe patient also meets the qualifying criteria for coverage of home health services, \npayment may be made for the reasonable and necessary home health services the patient \nneeds, notwithstanding the availability of coverage in a skilled nursing facility. \n \nEXAMPLE 3: \n \nA patient who needs skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis also hires a licensed \npractical (vocational) nurse to provide nighttime assistance while family members sleep.  \nThe care provided by the nurse, as respite to the family members, does not require the "

For purposes of the statute, an individual shall be \nconsidered \u201cconfined to the home\u201d (homebound) if the following two criteria are met: \n \n1.

Such \nclinical information about the patient\u2019s overall health status may include, but is not \nlimited to, such factors as the patient\u2019s diagnosis, duration of the patient\u2019s condition, \nclinical course (worsening or improvement), prognosis, nature and extent of functional \nlimitations, other therapeutic interventions and results, etc. \n "

Day Care Centers and Patient's Place of Residence \n \nThe current statutory definition of homebound or confined does not imply that Medicare \ncoverage has been expanded to include adult day care services. \n \nThe law does not permit an HHA to furnish a Medicare covered billable visit to a patient \nunder a home health plan of care outside his or her home, except in those limited \ncircumstances where the patient needs to use medical equipment that is too cumbersome \nto bring to the home.  Section 1861(m) of the Act stipulates that home health services \nprovided to a patient be provided to the patient on a visiting basis in a place of residence \nused as the individual's home.  A licensed/certified day care center does not meet the \ndefinition of a place of residence. \n \nC.  State Licensure/Certification of Day Care Facilities \n \nPer Section 1861(m)\n of the Act, an adult day care center must be either licensed or \ncertified by the State or accredited by a private accrediting body.  State licensure or \ncertification as an adult day care facility must be based on State interpretations of its \nprocess.  For example, several States do not license adult day care facilities as a whole, \nbut do certify some entities as Medicaid certified centers for purposes of providing adult \nday care under the Medicaid home and community based waiver program.  It is the \nresponsibility of the State to determine the necessary criteria for \"State certification\" in \nsuch a situation.  A State could determine that Medicaid certification is an acceptable \nstandard and consider its Medicaid certified adult day care facilities to be \"State \ncertified.\"  On the other hand, a State could determine Medicaid certification to be \ninsufficient and require other conditions to be met before the adult day care facility is \nconsidered \"State certified\". \n \nD.  Determination of the Therapeutic, Medical or Psychosocial Treatment of the \nPatient at the Day Care Facility \n \nIt is not the obligation of the HHA to determine whether the adult day care facility is \nproviding psychosocial treatment, but only to assure that the adult day care center is \nlicensed/certified by the State or accrediting body.  The intent of the law, in extending the \nhomebound exception status to attendance at such adult day care facilities, recognizes \nthat they ordinarily furnish psychosocial services. \n \n30.2 - Services Are Provided Under a Plan of Care Established and \nApproved by a Physician or Allowed Practitioner                                  \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) "

Skilled nursing services are covered where such skilled \nnursing services are necessary to maintain the patient\u2019s current condition or prevent or \nslow further deterioration so long as the beneficiary requires skilled care for the services \nto be safely and effectively provided.  When, however, the individualized assessment \ndoes not demonstrate such a necessity for skilled care, including when the services \nneeded do not require skilled nursing care because they could safely and effectively be \nperformed by the patient or unskilled caregivers, such services will not be covered under \nthe home health benefit. \n \nSkilled nursing care is necessary only when (a) the particular patient\u2019s special medical \ncomplications require the skills of a registered nurse or, when provided by regulation, a \nlicensed practical nurse to perform a type of service that would otherwise be considered \nnon-skilled; or (b) the needed services are of such complexity that the skills of a \nregistered nurse or, when provided by regulation, a licensed practical nurse are required \nto furnish the services.

To be considered reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or \ntreatment of the patient's illness or injury, the services must be consistent with the nature \nand severity of the illness or injury, the patient's particular medical needs, and accepted \nstandards of medical and nursing practice.  The determination of whether the services are \nreasonable and necessary should be made in consideration that a physician or allowed \npractitioner has determined that the services ordered are reasonable and necessary.  The \nservices must, therefore, be viewed from the perspective of the condition of the patient \nwhen the services were ordered and what was, at that time, reasonably expected to be \nappropriate treatment for the illness or injury throughout the certification period. \n \nA patient's overall medical condition, without regard to whether the illness or injury is \nacute, chronic, terminal, or expected to extend over a long period of time, should be \nconsidered in deciding whether skilled services are needed.  A patient's diagnosis should \nnever be the sole factor in deciding that a service the patient needs is either skilled or not \nskilled.  Skilled care may, depending on the unique condition of the patient, continue to \nbe necessary for patients whose condition is stable. \nAs is outlined in home health regulations, as part of the home health agency (HHA) \nConditions of Participation (CoPs), the clinical record of the patient must contain \nprogress and clinical notes.  Additionally, in Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing \nManual, Chapter 10; \u201cHome Health Agency Billing\u201d, instructions specify that for each \nclaim, HHAs are required to report all services provided to the beneficiary during each \n30-day period, which includes reporting each visit in line-item detail.

These clinical notes are also expected to provide important \ncommunication among all members of the home care team regarding the development, \ncourse and outcomes of the skilled observations, assessments, treatment and training \nperformed.  Taken as a whole then, the clinical notes are expected to tell the story of the \npatient\u2019s achievement towards his/her goals as outlined in the Plan of Care.  In this way, \nthe notes will serve to demonstrate why a skilled service is needed. \n \nTherefore the home health clinical notes must document as appropriate: \n \n\u2022 the history and physical exam pertinent to the day\u2019s visit, (including the response or \nchanges in behavior to previously administered skilled services) and the skilled \nservices applied on the current visit, and \n \n\u2022 the patient/caregiver\u2019s response to the skilled services provided, and "

Psychiatrically trained nurses are nurses who have special training and/or \nexperience beyond the standard curriculum required for a registered nurse.  The services \nof the psychiatric nurse are to be provided under a plan of care established and reviewed \nby a physician or allowed practitioner.  \n  \nBecause the law precludes agencies that primarily provide care and treatment of mental \ndiseases from participating as HHAs, psychiatric nursing must be furnished by an agency \nthat does not primarily provide care and treatment of mental diseases.  If a substantial \nnumber of an HHA's patients attend partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient \nprograms or receive other outpatient mental health services, the Medicare contractor will \nverify whether the patients meet the eligibility requirements specified in \u00a730 and whether \nthe HHA is primarily engaged in care and treatment of mental disease.  \n  \nServices of a psychiatric nurse would not be considered reasonable and necessary to \nassess or monitor use of psychoactive drugs that are being used for non-psychiatric \ndiagnoses or to monitor the condition of a patient with a known psychiatric illness who is \non treatment but is considered stable.

In most instances, this \ndefinition will be met if a patient requires a skilled nursing service at least once every 60 \ndays.  The exception to the intermittent requirement is daily skilled nursing services for \ndiabetics unable to administer their insulin (when there is no able and willing caregiver). \n \nSince the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing care makes the patient eligible for other \ncovered home health services, the Medicare contractor should evaluate each claim \ninvolving skilled nursing services furnished less frequently than once every 60 days.  In \nsuch cases, payment should be made only if documentation justifies a recurring need for \nreasonable, necessary, and medically predictable skilled nursing services.  The following \nare examples of the need for infrequent, yet intermittent, skilled nursing services: \n \n1. The patient with an indwelling silicone  catheter who generally needs a catheter \nchange only at 90-day intervals; \n \n2. The patient who experiences a fecal impaction (i.e., loss of bowel tone, restrictive \nmobility, and a breakdown in good health habits) and must receive care to \nmanually relieve the impaction.  Although these impactions are likely to recur, it \nis not possible to pinpoint a specific timeframe; or \n \n3. The blind diabetic who self- injects insulin may have a medically predictable \nrecurring need for a skilled nursing visit at least every 90 days.  These visits, for \nexample, would be to observe and determine the need for changes in the level and \ntype of care which have been prescribed thus supplementing the physician or \nallowed practitioner's contacts with the patient. \n \nThere is a possibility that a physician or allowed practitioner may order a skilled visit less \nfrequently than once every 60 days for an eligible beneficiary if there exists an \nextraordinary circumstance of anticipated patient need that is documented in the patient's \nplan of care in accordance with 42 CFR 409.43(b)\n.  A skilled visit frequency of less than \nonce every 60 days would only be covered if it is specifically ordered by a physician or \nallowed practitioner in the patient's plan of care and is considered to be a reasonable, \nnecessary, and medically predictable skilled need for the patient in the individual \ncircumstance. \n \nWhere the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing visits is medically predictable but a \nsituation arises after the first visit making additional visits unnecessary, e.g., the patient is \ninstitutionalized or dies, the one visit would be paid at the wage-adjusted LUPA amount \nfor that discipline type.  However, a one-time order; e.g., to give gamma globulin \nfollowing exposure to hepatitis, would not be considered a need for \"intermittent\" skilled \nnursing care since a recurrence of the problem that would require this service is not \nmedically predictable. \n \nAlthough most patients require services no more frequently than several times a week, \nMedicare will pay for part-time (as defined in \u00a750.7\n) medically reasonable and necessary \nskilled nursing care 7 days a week for a short period of time (2 to 3 weeks).

The goals of a maintenance \nprogram would be to maintain the patient\u2019s current functional status or to \nprevent or slow further deterioration. \n \n\u2022 Necessary periodic reevaluations by a qualified therapist of the beneficiary \nand maintenance program are covered if the specialized skills, knowledge, \nand judgment of a qualified therapist are required. \n \n\u2022 Where a maintenance program is not established until after the \nrehabilitative/restorative therapy program has been completed, or where \nthere was no rehabilitative/restorative therapy program, and the \nspecialized skills, knowledge, and judgment of a qualified therapist are \nrequired to develop a maintenance program, such services would be \nconsidered reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the patient\u2019s \ncondition in order to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment goals and \nensure medical safety.  When the development of a maintenance program \ncould not be accomplished during the last visits(s) of \nrehabilitative/restorative treatment, the therapist must document why the \nmaintenance program could not be developed during those last \nrehabilitative/restorative treatment visit(s). \n \n\u2022 When designing or establishing a maintenance program, the qualified \ntherapist must teach the patient or the patient's family or caregiver\u2019s \nnecessary techniques, exercises or precautions as necessary to treat the \nillness or injury.  The instruction of the beneficiary or appropriate \ncaregiver by a qualified therapist regarding a maintenance program is \ncovered if the specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment of a qualified \ntherapist are required.

Skilled \nrehabilitation services concurrent with the management of a patient's care plan include \nobjective tests and measurements such as, but not limited to, range of motion, strength, \nbalance, coordination, endurance, or functional ability. \n \nAs described in section 40.2.1(b), at defined points during a course of therapy, the \nqualified physical therapist (instead of an assistant) must perform the ordered therapy \nservice visit, assess the patient\u2019s function using a method which allows for objective \nmeasurement of function and comparison of successive measurements, and document the \nresults of the assessments, corresponding measurements, and effectiveness of the therapy \nin the patient\u2019s clinical record.

Physical therapy would be reasonable and necessary \nto teach the patient to climb and descend stairs safely.  Once the patient has reached the \ngoal of climbing and descending stairs safely, additional therapy services are no longer \nrequired, and thus would not be covered. \n \nEXAMPLE 3: \n \nA patient who has received gait training has reached their maximum restoration potential, \nand the physical therapist is teaching the patient and family how to safely perform the \nactivities that are a part of the maintenance program.  The visits by the physical therapist \nto demonstrate and teach the activities (which by themselves do not require the skills of a \ntherapist) would be covered since they are needed to establish the program (refer to \n\u00a740.2.1(d)(2)).

The initial evaluation of the patient's \nneeds, the designing of a maintenance program appropriate to the patient\u2019s capacity and \ntolerance and to the treatment objectives of the physician, the instruction of the patient, \nfamily or caregivers to carry out the program safely and effectively, and such \nreevaluations as may be required by the patient's condition, would constitute skilled \nphysical therapy.

Home health aide visits at an appropriate frequency \nwould be reasonable and necessary to assist in these tasks. \n \nEXAMPLE 2: \n \nA physician ordered four home health aide visits per week for personal care for a \nmultiple sclerosis patient who is unable to perform these functions because of increasing \ndebilitation.  The home health aide gave the patient a bath twice per week and washed \nhair on the other two visits each week.

Medicare coverage of the administration of insulin \nby a home health aide will depend on whether or not the agency is in compliance with all \nFederal and State laws and regulations related to this task.  However, when the task of \ninsulin administration has been delegated to the home health aide, the task must be \nconsidered and billed as a Medicare home health aide service.

The Law \n \nThe Medicare law governing the home health PPS is specific to the type of items and \nservices bundled to the HHA and the time the services are bundled.  Medical supplies are \nbundled while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  If a patient is admitted for \na condition which is related to a chronic condition that requires a medical supply (e.g., \nostomy patient) the HHA is required to provide the medical supply while the patient is \nunder a home health plan of care during a 30-day period of care.  The physician or \nallowed practitioner\u2019s orders in the plan of care must reflect all nonroutine medical \nsupplies provided and used while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  The \nconsolidated billing requirement is not superseded by the exclusion of certain medical \nsupplies from the plan of care and then distinguishing between medical supplies that are \nrelated and unrelated to the plan of care.  Failure to include medical supplies on the plan \nof care does not relieve HHAs from the obligation to comply with the consolidated \nbilling requirements.  The comprehensive nature of the current patient assessment and \nplan of care requirements looks at the totality of patient needs.  However, there could be a \ncircumstance where a physician or allowed practitioner could be uncomfortable with \nwriting orders for a preexisting condition unrelated to the reason for home health care.  In \nthose circumstances, PRN orders for such supplies may be used in the plan of care by a \nphysician or allowed practitioner. \n \nThus, all medical supplies are bundled while the patient is under a home health plan of \ncare.  This includes, but is not limited to, the above listed medical supplies as well as the \nPart B items provided in the final PPS rule.  The latter item lists are subsequently updated \nin accordance with the current process governing the deletion, replacement and revision \nof Medicare Part B codes.  Parenteral and enteral nutrition, prosthetics, orthotics, DME \nand DME supplies are not considered medical supplies and therefore not subject to \nbundling while the patient is under a home health plan of care.  However, \u00a71834(h)(4)(c)\n \nof the Act specifically excludes from the term \"orthotics and prosthetics\" medical \nsupplies including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags and supplies related to \nostomy care furnished by an HHA under \n\u00a71861(m) of the Act.  Therefore, these items are \nbundled while a patient is under a home health plan of care. \n \nB.  Relationship Between Patient Choice and Veterans Benefits \n \nFor veterans, both Medicare and Veteran's Administration (VA) benefits are primary.  \nTherefore, the beneficiary who is a veteran has some choices in cases where the benefits \noverlap.  The beneficiary, however, must select one or the other program as primary \nwhen obtaining active care.  If the VA is selected as primary for home health care, then \nMedicare becomes a secondary payer. An HHA must provide the medical supplies a "

The HHA may not require the \nbeneficiary to obtain or use medical supplies covered by the primary payer from any \nother source, including the VA. \n \nC.  Medical Supplies Purchased by the Patient Prior to the Start of Care \n \nA patient may have acquired medical supplies prior to his/her Medicare home health start \nof care date.  If a patient prefers to use his or her own medical supplies after having been \noffered appropriate supplies by the HHA and it is determined by the HHA that the \npatient's medical supplies are clinically appropriate, then the patient's choice is \ncontrolling.  The HHA is not required to duplicate the medical supplies if the patient \nelects to use his or her own medical supplies.  However, if the patient prefers to have the \nHHA provide medical supplies while the patient is under a Medicare home health plan of \ncare, then the HHA must provide the medical supplies.  The HHA may not require that \nthe patient obtain or use medical supplies from any other source.  Given the possibility of \nsubsequent misunderstandings arising between the HHA and the patient on this issue, the \nHHA should document the beneficiary's decision to decline HHA furnished medical \nsupplies and use their own resources. \n \n50.4.1.2 - Routine Supplies (Nonreportable) \n(Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21) \n \nRoutine supplies are supplies that are customarily used in small quantities during the \ncourse of most home care visits.

Routine supplies would not include those supplies that are \nspecifically ordered by the physician or allowed practitioner or are essential to HHA \npersonnel in order to effectuate the plan of care. \n \nExamples of supplies which are usually considered routine include, but are not limited to: \n \nA.

If two \nindividuals are present, but only one is needed to provide the care, only one visit may be \ncovered. \n \nA visit is initiated with the delivery of covered home health services and ends at the \nconclusion of delivery of covered home health services.  In those circumstances in which \nall reasonable and necessary home health services cannot be provided in the course of a \nsingle visit, HHA staff or others providing services under arrangements with the HHA \nmay remain at the patient's home between visits (e.g., to provide noncovered services).  \nHowever, if all covered services could be provided in the course of one visit, only one \nvisit may be covered. \n \nEXAMPLES: \n \n1. If an occupational therapist and an occupational therapy assistant visit the patient \ntogether to provide therapy and the therapist is there to supervise the assistant, \none visit is counted. \n \n2. If a nurse visits the patient in the morning to dress a wound and later must return \nto replace a catheter, two visits are counted. \n \n3. If the therapist visits the patient for treatment in the morning and the patient is \nlater visited by the assistant for additional treatment, two visits are counted. \n \n4. If an individual is taken to a hospital to receive outpatient therapy that could not \nbe furnished in their own home (e.g., hydrotherapy) and, while at the hospital \nreceives speech-language pathology services and other services, two or more \nvisits would be charged. \n \n5. Many home health agencies provide home health aide services on an hourly basis \n(ranging from 1 to 8 hours a day).  However, in order to allocate visits properly \nagainst a patient's maximum allowable visits, home health aide services are to be \ncounted in terms of visits.  Thus, regardless of the number of continuous hours a \nhome health aide spends in a patient's home on any given day, one \"visit\" is \ncounted for each such day.  If, in a rare situation, a home health aide visits a \npatient for an hour or two in the morning, and again for an hour or two in the \nafternoon, two visits are counted. \n \nC.  Evaluation Visits "
