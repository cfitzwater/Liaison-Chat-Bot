Home health and hospice \nare no exception. The Federal and State governments have specific standards of care written into law to \nprotect consumers and assure quality care. As a Medicare certified, Joint Commission accredited \nprogram, Intermountain Homecare & Hospice must abide by the regulations and standards for these \nand many other agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Office of Inspector General [OIG], \nState Practice Acts, etc.). Almost everything done, or not done, in home health and hospice are related \nto a regulation, standard, or identified as best practice. \nJoint Commission \nThe Joint Commission develops and maintains standards of quality that must be followed by an agency \nin order to be accredited. Joint Commission is not a government agency, and has no legal enforcement \npower, but offers an accreditation many agencies choose to obtain. Joint Commission accreditation is \nwidely recognized as one of the most important seals of approval in the health care marketplace. \nProfessionals employed by Joint Commission verify quality care and adherence to the standards by \nconducting Joint Commission surveys. One of the focuses of Joint Commission is patient safety. To \naddress this issue, Joint Commission has identified several National Patient Safety Goals that must be \nfollowed to achieve or maintain accreditation. \nNational Patient Safety Goals for Homecare \n(file://co.ihc.com/root/HC/Dept/Education/Orientation%20Documents/Clinical%20Orientation/Clinic\nal%20Handbook%20&%20%20Workbooks/2020/Regulation%20of%20Home%20Health%20&%20Hosp\nice%20Care) \nFunding Sources \nThere are several funding sources a patient may utilize to fund home health or hospice services: \n\u2022   Medicare \n\u2022   Medicaid \n\u2022   Commercial Insurance \n\u2022   Private Pay \n\u2022   Special Financial Consideration "

        "content": "Medicare \nMedicare is a federally funded insurance program for people age 65 or older. In addition, it also provides \nhealth care coverage to certain people with disabilities who are under age 65. Medicare is the single \nlargest payer for home health and hospice services. There are two types of Medicare, Traditional \nMedicare and Medicare Advantage Plans. \nMedicare consists of several parts.  Medicare \u201cPart A\u201d has no additional premium and includes hospital \nInsurance which pays for care in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health care, and Hospice care.  \nMedicare \u201cPart B\u201d requires an additional premium and pays for doctors, outpatient hospital care, home \nmedical equipment, and other medical services. Medicare \u201cPart D\u201d pays for medications and can be \nadded to Traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage Plans with an additional premium. \nMedicare Advantage Plans (Part C) are offered by private companies approved by Medicare and include \nthe same coverage as Traditional Medicare (Part A and B) as well as additional coverage. The additional \nbenefits usually include things such as vision and hearing services, health screening tests and nurse \nhelplines. Medicare Advantage Plans may or may not have an additional monthly premium, usually have \nlow co-pays, and include an annual out-of-pocket maximum. Some Medicare HMOs in our area include: \nSelect Health Medicare Advantage Plan, AARP, TriCare, etc. \nMedicare consists of several parts. \nAll Medicare plans have strict eligibility and reimbursement criteria that must be met. Patients must be \neligible for Medicare \u201cPart A\u201d in order to have home health or hospice coverage through Medicare. \nMedicare certification is required for agencies to receive payment for home health or hospice care \nprovided to Medicare and Medicaid patients. In order to be Medicare certified, the agency must follow \nthe Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP) for all patients, not just Medicare or Medicaid patients. \nThere are separate CoPs for Home Health and Hospice, each with different requirements. Agencies are \nsurveyed individually to determine whether and how each standard in the CoP is met. While an agency \nmay be found non-compliant with one or more of the subsidiary standards during any given survey, the \nagency cannot be found non-compliant with a Condition of Participation. An agency cannot participate \nin providing care for Medicare patients unless it meets every COP or attains substantial compliance with \nthe requirements. \nMedicaid \nMedicaid is a state and federally funded insurance for those who meet eligibility requirements. It is \navailable through the State for people with low income or people who cannot afford the cost of \nhealthcare. \nMedicaid regulations are found in the State Administrative Rules. Most of the regulations are similar to \nMedicare. When differences in regulations exist, we must follow the higher standard or more stringent \nregulation.  \nHospice care is a benefit through Medicaid and can be accessed when eligibility and reimbursement \ncriteria are met. Medicaid does require prior authorization for hospice services with the initiation of "

The signed \nelection statement and the physician certification statement must be received within 10 days of \nadmission.  \nMedicaid requires all Home Health services beyond the initial admit visit to be pre-authorized. The prior \nauthorization process for Home Health requires a complete Plan of Care and assessment note to be \nsubmitted to Medicaid. Medicaid must receive all required documentation within 10 days of admission. \nAdmission documentation must be completed in a timely manner. A limited amount of supplies may be \nprovided to the patient on the first visit only. All other supplies are to be provided by a Home Medical \nEquipment company. \nChanges to the original Plan of Care must also be coordinated with the Central Pre-Authorization Team \nto process requests for payment of additional services. \nMedicaid requires that an admission to Home Health must be completed by an RN, even when therapy \nservices are the only skill ordered by a physician. \nCommercial Insurance \nMany people have insurance through a privately-owned company, often provided through their \nemployer. Most insurance policies pay for home health or hospice services, but not all. Different \ninsurances also provide different coverage and have different eligibility and reimbursement criteria. \nCommercial insurance policies will often pay for both skilled and personal care services to be provided \nby home health. All home health services need to be pre-authorized. The pre-authorization process \nrequires a complete Plan of Care and assessment note to be submitted in a timely manner (within 24-72 \nhours of admission). Changes to the original Plan of Care must be coordinated with the Central Pre-\nAuthorization Team to process requests for payment of additional services. \nPrivate Pay  \nSome patients who do not have insurance and do not qualify for Medicaid or Medicare may choose to \npay for home health or hospice services independently. This means they will pay out of pocket for the \nHome Health or Hospice care received. \nSpecial Financial Consideration  \nFor patients who are unable to afford needed healthcare, Home Health or Hospice services may be \ncovered through a financial assistance program offered by Intermountain Homecare & Hospice. \nPatients must apply for this program in order to be considered to receive financial assistance. \nPayment \nMedicare, Medicaid, and most commercial insurances reimburse for hospice services based on a per- \ndiem rate. This means the hospice receives payment for each day the patient is on service. \nAdjustments to the rate are made based on the level of care the patient requires. Hospice must provide \nall services necessary (nursing, social work, medications, supplies, etc.) to treat the symptoms \nassociated with the terminal diagnosis. Occasionally, insurance may pay for services on a fee for service "

However, with hospice and the progression of the terminal illness, \npatients usually require a 24-hour caregiver. It is the role of the social worker and the hospice team to \nidentify an alternative plan that can be quickly implemented when the patient reaches the point where \nhe/she is no longer safe to be alone. To prevent a crisis, this plan for around-the-clock caregiving should \nbe developed within the first couple of days after hospice admission, even if it will not need to be \nimplemented for a long time. \nDetermining Terminal Illness  \nAt the start of hospice care and for each recertification for hospice services, the patient must be \nevaluated for eligibility and the diagnosis of a terminal illness. As stated earlier, a terminal illness means \nthat the individual has a medical prognosis of 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal course based \nupon the physician\u2019s judgment. \nAll Medicare Hospice claims are processed through a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). The \nMAC that processes Utah claims is CGS Administrators, National Government Services (NGS) process \nclaims for Idaho. Each MAC has a set of guidelines that is used in reviewing hospice claims and can be \nused by hospice providers as a guide to determine eligibility of patients for hospice services. "

A summary \nof these guidelines is available in the help cards. \nLippincott \u2013 LCD Helpcard \nThe above guidelines refer to several assessment tools used to help determine prognosis; the Karnofsky \nPerformance Status (KPS) or Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), the Functional Assessment Staging \n(FAST), and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification. The PPS is used for all \nhospice patients and should be assessed and documented on admission, recertification, and with \nchanges in patient function. The FAST is used for dementia patients and should be assessed and \ndocumented on admission, recertification, and with changes in patient function. The NYHA Functional \nClassification is used for patients with heart disease and should be assessed and documented on \nadmission, recertification, and with any changes to condition. These tools are included in the hospice SN \nassessment forms and are available in the help cards. \nPhysician Certification \nHome Health Face to Face \nThe physician must document that he, or an allowed non-physician practitioner (NPP), has had a face-to-\nface encounter with the patient. The face-to-face encounter must occur within the 90 days prior to the \nstart of home health care, or within the 30 days after the start of care and be related to the primary \nreason the patient required home health services. \nThe documentation must include the date when the physician or allowed NPP saw the patient, and \nsupport the patient's homebound status, need for skilled services, and reason for being admitted to \nHome Health. \nHome Health Physician Re certification \nAt the time of each recertification, for all Medicare Home Health patients, the physician must recertify \nthat there is a continuing need for Home Health services.  The physician must include an estimate of \nhow long Home Health skilled services will be required. \nHospice Certification of Terminal Illness  \nFor the first 90-day hospice benefit period, both the patient\u2019s Attending Physician and the Hospice \nPhysician must certify in writing that, the patient has a terminal illness with a prognosis of 6 months or \nless, if the disease were to run its normal course. The Attending Physician who signs the certification \nmust be a Doctor of Medicine or osteopathy or a nurse practitioner and is identified by the patient at \nthe time he or she elects the hospice benefit. \nThe Certification of Terminal Illness must be received from both physicians; either verbally or in writing, \nno more than 15 calendar days prior to the start of care and within 2 calendar days after hospice care is \ninitiated.  If verbal certification is given, the written Certification of Terminal Illness must be received \nprior to billing for hospice care.

A signed Certification of Terminal Illness must be received prior to billing for hospice \ncare. \nFor the initial and each subsequent certification, the Hospice Physician must write a narrative indicating \nwhy he/she believes the patient has a terminal illness. \nHospice Face to Face Medicare  \nThe Hospice Physician must have a face-to-face visit with each hospice patient anticipated to reach the \n3rd benefit period. The face-to-face must occur no more than 30 calendar days prior to the 3rd benefit \nperiod recertification. Subsequent face-to-face visits must occur for every recertification thereafter and \nmust be no more than 30 calendar days prior to the recertification.

A physician who is not employed by hospice must \ncomplete the \u201cIndependent Physician Review for Extended Care\u201d form within 45 days before the end of \nthe current 12-month period.  The review must include sufficient evidence that the patient continues to \nmeet eligibility criteria. This form should be requested and obtained by nurses or social workers. \nObtain the Independent Physician Review form your office manager. \nHospice Services \nA set of core services must be provided by Hospice employees.  These services include nursing services, \nmedical social services provided by social workers, and counseling services (spiritual, dietary, and \nbereavement counseling). Other services that must be provided by the Hospice include physician \nservices, continuous home care, respite care, bereavement counseling, special modalities, and volunteer \nservices. These services are explained in more detail throughout this module. "

The Hospice physician is responsible for participating in the establishment, \nreview and updating of plans of care, face-to-face visits, supervising care and services, and establishing \ngoverning policies. \nHospice Physician Professional Services  \nThe Hospice Physician may provide direct patient care services i.e., home visits to the patient. Direct \npatient care services provided by the Hospice Physician may be billed by Hospice, as a separate charge \nto Medicare, and are not part of the hospice per diem reimbursement.  Only the professional services \nprovided to the patient may be billed to Medicare.  The technical components of the visit (i.e. lab \nservices, x-rays, etc.) are not billable to Medicare and are paid for by Hospice. Face-to-face visits are \nconsidered an administrative function and are not billable unless medically reasonable and necessary \ncare related to the hospice terminal diagnosis was also provided during the visit. \nIndependent Attending Physician Services  \nPatient care services provided by an independent Attending Physician (a physician who is not employed \nby or under contract with the Hospice) are not part of the hospice per diem reimbursement and are the \nonly physician services that can be billed to Medicare Part B directly.  The technical components of the \nvisit (i.e. lab services, x-rays, etc.) are not billable to Medicare and are paid for by Hospice if they are \napproved by Hospice and included in the hospice plan of care (or paid for by the family if not approved). \nConsulting Physician Services  \nThe Hospice may refer the patient to a Consulting Physician as part of the hospice plan of care for help \nin the palliation or management of the terminal illness or related conditions.  The physician bills Hospice \nfor these services. \nIf Hospice has a contract with the Consulting Physician, these charges may be billed to Medicare Part A \non the hospice bill.  If Hospice does not have a contract with the Consulting Physician, Hospice is \nresponsible to pay for these services. \nOnly the professional services provided to the patient may be billed to Medicare by the Hospice.   The \ntechnical components of the visit (i.e. lab services, x-rays, etc.) are not billable to Medicare and are paid \nfor by Hospice if they are approved by Hospice and included in the hospice plan of care (or paid for by \nthe family if not approved). \nServices provided by any physician, other than the Attending Physician, that are NOT included as part of \nthe hospice plan of care, are not billable to Medicare or to Hospice and become the responsibility of the \npatient. \nHospice retains the responsibility for the overall management of the Hospice patient, even when they \nare referred to a Consulting Physician.

Hospice is responsible to ensure services are furnished in a safe and \neffective manner, in accordance with the hospice plan of care, regardless of their location (home, \noutpatient, or inpatient facility).  Hospice retains responsibility for patient/family assessment, \ninterdisciplinary care conferences, and continuity of patient/family care, regardless of the setting. \nServices provided by individuals or entities on behalf of Intermountain Homecare & Hospice must \noperate under a written agreement or contract.  The contract must clearly stipulate that services may be \nprovided only with the express authorization of the Hospice.  Exceptions to this arrangement should be \ndiscussed with the Hospice Manager. \nHospice Item Set (HIS) \nThe Hospice Item Set (HIS) includes specific information that is pulled from individual patient \nassessments and sent to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  The information is then \nused to compare the quality of care provided by different Hospice agencies.  If an agency does not \nsubmit the HIS for each patient on admission and discharge, the agency is given a deduction in payment \nthe followi ng year. \nHospice Levels of Care \nThe Medicare and Medicaid hospice benefit include four different levels of care.

Once the pain \nis managed or symptoms stabilized, the patient must return to a routine level of care. \nRespite Care \nInpatient Respite Care is provided to the patient when necessary to relieve the family members or other \npersons caring for the individual at home. Respite care does not require a worsening of the patient\u2019s \ncondition. Inpatient Respite Care is not available for patients that are residents of long-term care or \nnursing facilities. Respite care is short term inpatient care limited to no more than five consecutive days \nat a time. This care is provided on an occasional basis.  Respite Care may be provided in a hospital or \nskilled nursing facility as long as nursing services are available to meet the patient\u2019s needs.   The facility \nmust have a contract with the Hospice to provide Inpatient Respite Care. \nContinuous Home Care  \nContinuous home care is to be provided during periods of crisis to maintain the patient at home. A \nperiod of crisis is a period of time when the patient requires continuous care for at least 8 hours in a 24-\nhour period (midnight to midnight) to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. \nThe care does not have to be \u201ccontinuous\u201d to qualify but must total eight hours or more of care within \nthe 24-hour period. The care can be provided by a Nurse Practitioner, RN, LPN or Certified Nurse \nAssistant (CNA). However, a nurse must provide at least 50 percent of the total care provided. \nAll nursing and CNA services provided must be counted into the continuous care time. A hospice cannot \nchoose to count fewer CNA hours than were provided in order to get the percentage of nurse hours up \nto 50 percent. Time spent doing documentation, modification of the plan of care, and supervision of \naides does NOT count as part of the continuous care hours. \nAssisted Living Fa cilities \nHospice services may be provided to residents of both type I and type II assisted living facilities.  A \nwritten agreement or formal contract is not required. \nResidents of type I assisted living facilities are required to be ambulatory, minimally dependent on staff \nfor assistance with ADLs, in stable health, and able to take life-saving action in an emergency.  The type I \nfacility staff may only assist residents who self-medicate by providing reminders, opening child-proof \ncaps, and opening unit-dosed packages. \nResidents of type II assisted living facilities are either independent or semi-dependent and must be able \nto take life-saving action in an emergency with the assistance of one person.  The type II facility staff \nmay supervise medication administration. \nHospice patients are allowed to stay in their home to die, including an assisted living facility.  The \nHospice should obtain a copy of the Facility\u2019s \u201cService Plan\u201d for the patient and should provide copies of \nthe hospice plan of care to the Facility.

Hospice may not \nask patients to revoke the hospice benefit. A patient\u2019s Medicare benefits are reinstated at the time the \npatient revokes the hospice benefit.

A new hospice benefit period (BP) is started at the time of re-election. \nPatient Discharge by Home Health or Hospice  \nHome health or hospice may choose to withdraw services if the following apply: \n\u2022   The agency has inadequate personnel, equipment, and resources available to provide services \nrequired.  \n\u2022   Patient or significant other is unable or unwilling to be compliant with the plan of care. \n\u2022   The patient has an unsafe home environment. \n\u2022   There is a perceived personal risk to the employee. \nHome health and hospice must also discharge (or transfer) a patient that moves out of the service area. \nHospice must discharge a patient if it determines that the patient is no longer terminally ill, as defined \nby a prognosis of 6 months or less.  The term for this type of discharge is decertification.  Alternative \nplacement of the patient (e.g., nursing facility) should be evaluated before discharging the patient and \nthe Manager and Hospice Physician must be involved in the decision to withdraw services for one of the \nabove reasons. \nA patient\u2019s traditional Medicare or other regular medical benefits are reinstated at the time the patient \nis discharged from Hospice.  When a Hospice patient is discharged, they lose any remaining days in that \nhospice benefit period.  (This regulation had an impact years ago when there were limited hospice \nbenefit periods.  The only impact now is that the patient may move from the two 90-day benefit periods \nto 60-day periods quicker.)

While you are receiving hospice services, your \nhospice eligibility is re-evaluated regularly. \nWhat is a hospice plan of care?\nYour hospice team, along with you and your family, will \ndevelop an individualized plan to guide your care in hospice. \nThis plan of care lists the treatments and services needed to \nmeet your goals for pain and symptom control. It also lists \nservices needed to meet any emotional, social, and spiritual \nneeds for you and your family.\nHospice care \nfocuses\u00a0on:\n\u2022 Meeting your needs \nand\u00a0supporting \nyour\u00a0family\n\u2022 Managing your pain \nand\u00a0symptoms\n\u2022 Giving you comfort \nand\u00a0support \n\u2022 Allowing you and your \nfamily to live life to \nits\u00a0fullest\n\u2022 Supporting and \neducating your \ncaregiver to \nprovide\u00a0you comfort \nand dignity\n\u2022 Preparing you and  \nyour family for the \nend\u00a0of\u00a0life \n"

Intermountain Hospice Services  \nManaging Pain in  \nAdvanced Illness\nPeople with advanced illness are often concerned about \npain. They worry that the pain will be more than they can \nhandle, or what the side effects will be. Please share your \nconcerns with your care team. Hospice nurses are trained \nto help manage pain in the most effective way possible. \nEveryone experiences and reacts to pain differently. What \nmay be tolerable for some will be unbearable for others. \nSuccessful pain management does not always mean \ntaking away all of the pain\u00a0\u2014 but rather, bringing it down \nto an acceptable level. The nurse will work with you to \nset an individual goal for pain relief. You will frequently be \nasked how intense your pain is on a scale of 0 to 10. This \nprovides a standard way to compare how your pain is \nbeing managed, if your goal for pain relief is being met, or \nif additional interventions are\u00a0needed.\nPain relief medications\nDepending on the severity of your pain, you may start with a \nmedication like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, \nAdvil). If you do not have good pain relief with these non-\nopioid medications, your doctor will likely prescribe an opioid. \nOpioids are narcotic medications that are very effective at \nrelieving pain. \nCommon opioid pain medications used in hospice\u00a0are: \n\u2022 Morphine (Roxanol) \n\u2022 Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)\n\u2022 Oxycodone (Percocet)\n\u2022 Dolophine (Methadone)\nThese medications are started at small doses and gradually \nincreased as needed. The best way to keep your pain \nmanaged is to take the medications on a schedule. Do not let \nyour pain become severe by waiting too long between doses. \nOnce pain gets out of control, it could take hours or days to \nget it controlled again.\nLiquid medicines are often used when pills cannot be chewed \nor swallowed. These medicines can be given with a medicine \ndropper or a syringe without a needle.\nThe importance of \npain management\nPain management \nmakes you feel more \ncomfortable \u2014 and also \nprovides these benefits: \n\u2022 Increases energy\n\u2022 Lowers stress\n\u2022 Decreases the \nseverity of many other \nsymptoms\nAbout pain \nmedications\nMany people fear they \nmay become addicted \nto morphine or other \nopioid pain medications. \nHowever, when \ntaken as prescribed, \nthese medications \nare reliable and safe. \nBesides reducing pain, \nopioids can improve \nbreathing and ease \nuncomfortable feelings \nof\u00a0breathlessness."

Your caregiver \nshould\u00a0not insist that you take food or fluids.\n\u2022 Eat ice chips or take small sips of fluid that can \nbe\u00a0sucked\u00a0from a sponge or a moist washcloth.  \n\u2022 To ease dryness:\n \u2013 Wipe lips with a cool, moist\u00a0washcloth. \n \u2013 Use an oral moisturizer on your\u00a0teeth and gums. \n \u2013 Apply small amounts of lip balm  \n(like ChapStick\u00a0or\u00a0Vaseline). \n \u2013 Use a water-based product (like\u00a0K-Y\u00a0Jelly)\u00a0on dry \nlips\u00a0and\u00a0nostrils (if using\u00a0oxygen\u00a0therapy)."

The sleep may \nseem\u00a0deeper and it may be difficult to wake. This change \nsignals a slowing of the body\u2019s metabolism.\nHow your caregiver can help:\n\u2022 Note if there are times of the day when your loved one \nis more alert and has more energy.  Try to plan visits and \nactivities for these times.\n\u2022 Realize that your presence matters and is a comfort.  Even \nif your loved one is asleep or can\u2019t carry on a conversation, \nthey know you are near.\n\u2022 Talk or read. Play music or sing quietly. Your loved one \nmay\u00a0hear your voice and find it soothing.\n\u2022 Reach out. Hold your loved one\u2019s hand. Stroke their hair \nor rub lotion on their hands. As your loved one withdraws, \nremember that this is simply part of the dying process, not \na rejection. Your caring touch can comfort your loved one \nand\u00a0express your connection.\nBody temperature, skin changes\nYour hands, feet, and limbs may become cool to the touch. \nYou may also notice that the skin is splotchy and very pale \ngray or dusky purple. It may be darker on the underside of \nthe body. These changes are signs that your circulation is \nslowing\u00a0down.\nHow your caregiver can help:\n\u2022 Use blankets, socks, and slippers to keep your loved \none\u00a0warm.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t use an electric blanket or heating pad. The heat may \nbe too intense for your loved one\u2019s skin.\n\u2022 Keep in mind that even though the skin feels cool, your \nloved one may feel hot and want to take off the blankets.  \nIn this case, don\u2019t insist on blankets. Do whatever seems \ncomfortable to your loved one."

As you take in less fluid and food, \nthere\u2019s less waste. Also, the kidneys may be shutting down. \nDuring this time, it\u2019s also common to begin to lose bladder \nand bowel control.\n\u2022 If necessary, use disposable diapers and bed pads.\n\u2022 Consider asking the care team about the bladder and bowel \nchanges. They can determine, for example, if a catheter or \nmedication would be helpful.\nAwareness and mood\nYou may become increasingly confused about time, place, \nand people.

At times, you may feel \nrestless or upset \u2014 picking at the sheets, changing positions \na lot, seeing things that aren\u2019t there, and so on. These \nbehaviors are caused by changes in the body during the \ndying process, such as less oxygen to the brain, less fluid in \nthe body, and lower kidney function. Medications, pain, and \ninfection can cause shifts in mood and awareness.\nHow your caregiver can help:\n\u2022 As often as needed and as long as \nit seems comforting, remind your \nloved one of the day, time, and \nsurroundings. Speak in a gentle, \nreassuring tone.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t insist on \u201ccorrecting\u201d your \nloved one.
